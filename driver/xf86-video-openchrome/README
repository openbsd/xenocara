---------------------
(http://www.openchrome.org)

SUPPORTED CHIPSETS :
--------------------
- CLE266 (VT3122)
- KM400/P4M800 (VT3205)
- K8M800 (VT3204)
- PM800/PM880/CN400 (VT3259)
- VM800/CN700/P4M800Pro (VT3314)
- CX700 (VT3324)
- P4M890 (VT3327)
- K8M890 (VT3336)
- P4M900/VN896 (VT3364)


SUPPORTED FEATURES :
--------------------
- Free modesetting for Unichrome and Unichrome Pro chipset.
- VBE modesetting for everything not natively supported.
- TV-out support.
- EXA acceleration.
- Hardware MPEG2 acceleration.


IMPORTANT NOTE :
----------------
- The driver name is now 'openchrome', and this is what you need to use in
  your xorg.conf now (instead of 'via'). The XvMC libraries have also been
  renamed, to 'libchromeXvMC.so' and 'libchromeXvMCPro.so'.


KNOWN BUGS/LIMITATIONS :
------------------------
* Laptop panel
- Laptop displays for anything other than CLE266 and KM400/P4M800 are only
  supported thru VBE calls.
- Virtual terminal is broken on some laptop displays. Use a vesa framebuffer to
  work around that (append vga=791 to your kernel command line, for example).

* XvMC
- The hardware MPEG4 acceleration that is present on some chipsets is not
  implemented.
- No XvMC support for CX700 (new, unsupported engine).
- No XvMC support for K8M890, P4M890 and P4M900/VN896 (need to get dri working
  for them first).

* TV output
- TV modes are hardcoded and must be choosen inside a list depending on the TV
  encoder.
- Outputs are dependent on each other and will use the least common
  denominator. If you're using both VGA/LCD output and TV output, the VGA/LCD
  output will be limited by the TV encoder (720x576@50Hz for example).
  In other words, there is no dual screen support.

* Misc.
- Add-on and integrated TMDS encoders are not supported, except thru VBE.

* Chrome9
- Chrome9 chipsets' family (P4M900 and K8M890) currently doesn't
  support neither AGP DMA nor 3D acceleration. 


Please note that 3D acceleration is provided by Mesa (http://mesa3d.org) and is
not directly related to openchrome.
