    Add config.h include to src/lx_memory.c
    
    The src/lx_memory.c file uses the xf86.h header file.  This file must have
    HAVE_STRNDUP defined before calling it when the building platform has a strndup
    function.  When using config.h, this file doesn't have that define and so fails
    to compile.
    
    The attached patch adds the conditional config.h to this file so it may compile
    on the affected platforms.
    
    The patch is trivial and may be included and used under whatever licensing
    desired.

    lx_exa: Improvements to negative srcX/Y PictOpSrc/Over operations
    
    Adds handling of negative srcX or srcY coordinates, which is used by gtk3
    GtkTrayIcon implementation via cairo for centering icons on top of the
    destination area.
    
    For now just handle the drawing within source pixmap bounds in these
    cases, as full handling of the out of bound zero-vector for PictOpSrc
    seems to require bigger refactoring, which is not suitable for the
    impending stable release.
    The approach implemented here should result in correct rendering for
    PictOpOver (as out of bounds with non-repeat mode ends up meaning
    transparency). For PictOpSrc no black borders are rendered where
    appropriate, but before this approach, no source pixmap would even be
    rendered at all, so it should be a net improvement for the upcoming
    release, while fixing the gtk3 icons in GNOME3 fallback.
    
    The completely out of bounds special case check didn't work correctly for
    negative srcX or srcY because exaScratch.srcWidth/Height are unsigned
    types, so the negative srcX or srcY got casted to unsigned, which resulted
    in a big number, so srcX >= 0 was always true (but GCC managed to not warn
    of the implicit signedness cast).

    lx_exa: Implement solid pictures support as source with a mask
    
    cairo-1.12 uses solid pictures instead of 1x1R pixmaps in glyph rendering
    paths, so accelerate it.
    In addition to acceleration, it avoids a bug in xserver-1.13.0 and earlier
    which causes visible misrendering for fallback path, making cairo-1.12 a
    viable and desired choice on GeodeLX systems.
    Quick benchmarking suggests a 4-12% win in cairo-traces.

    lx_exa: Fix crash with solid fills on PictOpAdd operations
    
    lx_check_composite has many special checks for PictOpAdd to return
    successfully early, but these were done even earlier than the check
    for solid fills. This resulted in lx_prepare_composite assuming
    the source pixmap exists, which is not the case with solid fills.
    Move the solid fill fallback checks before the others, so we are
    guaranteed to always have a source pixmap in PrepareComposite and
    Composite and don't crash trying to access a NULL pointer.
    
    Also move up the mask check to do less checks in the PictOpAdd logic.

    z4l.c: drop unnecessary #include linux/types.h
    
    On hybrid platforms, such as Debian GNU/KFreeBSD, that support V4L2
    and yet without providing the full complement of Linux headers, ZTV
    fails to compile because of this missing header.
    
    Given how removing this header does not adversely affect compiling,
    plus it might improve portability, we went ahead and removed it.
    
    Nonetheless, as observed by Gaetan Nadon, z4l.c includes code that
    explicitly disables the module on any OS other than Linux:
    
        LoaderGetOS(&osname, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    
        if (osname == NULL || strcmp(osname, "linux") != 0) {
        if (errmaj)
            *errmaj = LDR_BADOS;
        if (errmin)
            *errmin = 0;
    
        return NULL;
        }
    
    Still, in the interest of OS neutrality, we decided to leave recent
    autoconf magic in place and to let OS vendors figure out how to get
    the module loaded on non-Linux OS themselves. Patches are welcome.

    Geode 2.11.13
    
    This release mainly features a complete overhaul of the building scripts plus
    a cleanup of deprecated macros. The key benefit is that this Geode driver can
    finally build on FreeBSD and on other platforms not offering V4L2 support and
    that it can also build on a 64-bit host using its 32-bit personality.
    
    Support for the Video Input Port (VIP) feature of the Geode LX found in 'ztv'
    is now documented and the source code saw the removal of deprecated Linux 2.4
    backward compatibility code. Compiling is skipped on platforms without V4L2.
    
    Configuration for laptops featuring WXGA resolutions is finally documented.
    
    Setting the GEODE_TRACE_FALL macro now enables composite operation tracing on
    this driver. This can be used to profile the performance during development.
    
    Fixes to keep this driver compilable on recent X servers are also included.

    Remove unrequired large file descriptor partial support
    
    The LFS "transitional extension" API is deprecated and is not available on FreeBSD.
    Large file support (64 bit) is not required on the geode 32 bit only architecture.
    
    There are some hints that the LFS transional extension API were not used
    correclty. The variable holding the value is held in an unsigned long rather
    than in off_t. The msr open call did not use the O_LARGEFILE flag and did not
    check for EOVERFLOW.

    Move back ztv with geode driver
    
    Now we have a clean separation between CPP flags and C Flags
    Only the C Flags apply to both geode and ztv driver, however
    it is not worth doing a per target compilation.
    
    Should some flags become mutually exclusive and if we want to have
    both target in the same makefile, add the incompatible flag
    on the appropriate target, example:
    
    geode_drv_la_CFLAGS = $(AM_CFLAGS) -newCFlag
    and/or
    geode_drv_la_CPPFLAGS = $(AM_CPPFLAGS) -newCPPFlag
    
    Note that both AM_CFLAGS and AM_CPPFLAGS are picked-up by both
    geode and ztv driver target.

    Detect 32bit support on 64bit OS and compile with -m32 if found
    
    For gcc compiler only at the moment.
    The configuration reports if support is found or not, e.g.:
    
       checking if gcc supports the -m32 Intel/AMD option... yes
    
    The configuration C test relies on #include unistd.h which includes
    features.h which includes gnu/stubs.h which includes gnu/stubs-32.h
    which is missing on 64 bit system without the 32 bit library support.
    
    Tested on x86_64 AMD64 CPU with/without libc6-dev-i386 which provides
    32 bit support. Remains to be tested on Geode and FreeBSD 32/64 bit.
    
    The configuration does not attempt to decide if building should proceed
    or be aborted. If no 32 bit support then the build will die in the
    assembly code as it always did before.
    
    The variable M32_CFLAGS provides the flag for the makefiles.
    The variable names and organization is subject to change.

    Add a configure option to enable/disable building the ztv driver
    
    Even when V4L2 is available there are always reasons why distros
    may not want to build the driver.
    
    This patch uses a common idiom in xorg.
    When no configure option is specified ztv is built iff v4l2 is detected (auto).
    When user issues --disable-ztv, the ztv driver is not built (no)
    When user issues --enable-ztv, the ztv driver is built (yes) if v4l2 is detected
    but the configuration fails if v4l2 is missing. Distros do not want silent
    failures when a feature is explicitly requested but cannot be built.

    Move ztv driver to it's own directory
    
    The convention is to have the video driver (geode) in the src subdir
    and any other targets (utils, apps, other drivers) in their own
    directory. It makes it much simpler to right a correct makefile
    and to set conditional compile.
    
    This highlighted a few things to fix. For now, the directory includes
    have not been copied as they are required. The AM_CCASFLAGS is not required
    either as there is no assembler.
    
    Other than that, the gcc command issued has no differences. Other unrequired
    defines could be removed later.

    Fix packed overlay offscreen allocations
    
    Commit 5e72a00ad2 caused packed video data to corrupt glyphs and other
    parts of the screen, but it turns out that the commit actually at fault
    was d681a844e, incorrectly changing the size of the allocated destination
    memory from the number of bytes needed to the number of lines needed.
    
    While fixing this, I noticed that LXAllocateSurface is probably making the
    same mistake, and that the height is probably not calculated correctly for
    some corner cases when calling LXCopyFromSys in the packed
    video path (but I'm not sure about either).

    The LX is a bit odd in that the palette can be used for gamma correction
    of graphics data, or video data, but not both at the same time.
    
    Right now, during X startup, X sets gamma correction (but without any
    actual correction) causing the Geode driver to start using the palette
    for graphics gamma correction. (this is just momentary)
    
    Later on during startup, vg_set_custom_mode() switches to using the
    palette for video gamma correction, and this is the end result.
    
    If you later use xrandr to change the gamma, the palette starts being used
    for graphics again.
    
    If you VT switch, vg_set_custom_mode (momentarily) starts using the palette
    for video, but then X jumps in with a gamma callback causing it to be used
    for graphics again.
    
    End result: no user visible bug, but this is inconsistent.
    As there is no exposed mechanism for changing video gamma I suggest
    we just drop that bit from vg_set_custom_mode(). Then the inconsistency
    goes away.
    
    Downside: this now becomes dependent on X setting gamma during startup.
    I don't know when this was introduced but I think it is recent.
    
    Aditionally, I think I found a (harmless) bug in
    df_set_video_palette_entry, it doesn't do what the comments say.

    Add get_crtc output function
    
    I don't know why X can't do this itself, but when no get_crtc method is
    provided, X decides that it doesn't know the CRTC of the output and
    decides to reset the mode completely (causing display powerdown, resulting
    in an uncomfortable visual interruption to OLPC's boot process).

    Fix the Nautilus file browser misrendering issue
    
    This is patch 4 final this week.
    This one has fixed several bugs below:
    1)google chrome hang
    2)Some website using repeat for source picture with PictOpSrc. To sum up, right now this patch has gracefully solved the Nautilus bug and some special rendering under PictOpSrc and PictOpOver I will describe all special conditions I met
    Websites for test before and after this patch:
    	1)http://daduke.org (greater srcX and srcY)
    	2)http://bjdns2.cncmax.cn (negative srcX and srcY)
    
    From: Frank Huang <frankr.huang@amd.com>
    
    *When the srcX or srcY is greater than source width or source height
    (or negative),the driver should do the correct region to render. Add a
    function lx_composite_onepass_special to handle this. The source start
    point should be calculated by a modulus operation.
    *If the opeartion is with a shifted position src, then adjust the
    operation region based on the operations src width and height
    parameters. The rotation condition should be excluded. This part still
    need investigation

    LXCopyFromSys currently is hardcoded to operate on 16bpp data.
    And indeed, when working with packed data (e.g. YUY2), this is the case.
    
    However, it is also used from LXCopyPlanar to copy the planes of I420
    images. In this case, it is on an 8bpp input plane.
    
    Running at 16bpp causes twice as much data to be copied, and ultimately
    causes a buffer overflow leading to crashes such as
    http://dev.laptop.org/ticket/10260
    
    Fix this by deriving the BPP from the input image parameters.

    If the opeartion is with a shifted position mask, then adjust the
    operation region based on the operations mask width and height
    parameters(instead of clipping based on source width/height)

    lx_exa: fallback in case of server-side gradients and solid fill
    
    RENDER extension version 0.10 added support for doing server-side
    gradients and solid fills, which we were not handling at all.
    cairo-1.9 started making use of server-side gradients, and we are
    crashing on those, as the source pixmap (pxSrc in lx_prepare_composite)
    doesn't have a drawable in this case, and we were not expecting such
    a possibility.
    So, as the first measure, fallback (three years late) all server-side
    gradients and solid fills instead of crashing, until we have no code
    that tries to accelerate cases of these or aren't sure if we even
    can accelerate any cases.
    
    pSourcePict member was added to xserver in 2005, so no compatibility
    wrapping needed.

    Bring all the "return FALSE" condition forward from lx_prepare_composite

    with libpciaccess we're finding the ISA device and checking its BARs,
    but we're not bothering to fill in the BAR information via
    pci_device_probe.  This results in a 0'd out bar and:

    Crasher fix: Use ExaDriverAlloc() to calloc the EXA struct.
    
    Patch from Kyle McMartin.  A recent exa/exa.c commit from Dave Airlie
    (02ae85c4..) added a new member to the EXA struct, and corresponding
    code to call it if it's non-NULL.  We were using calloc with sizeof()
    that struct at driver-compile-time; as a result, after the ABI change
    the new member contained garbage, passed the EXA test for NULL, was
    called, and segfaulted at startup.

    Change OLPC detection heuristic to one that works on upstream kernels
    
    We've been checking whether we have a DCON/are on an OLPC by looking for
    files from the "olpc_dcon" kernel module.  This module isn't upstream yet,
    so this only works for the OLPC custom kernel.  We might as well check for
    an OLPC kernel module that *is* upstream, so that we can run on unmodified
    distributions.  This patch moves us to checking for "olpc-ac" instead.

    xf86-video-geode: after reloading cursors, hide the cursor
    
    Whenever we reload cursors, the geode driver needs to call hide_cursor()
    to ensure that the cursor is hidden until we finally unhide the cursor.
    Without this, we see ghost cursors during rotation or VT switches.

    xf86-video-geode: fix up cursor size (again)
    
    The geode hardware (and cimarron) expects cursor memory size to be 48x64,
    and cimarron will zero out the excess when a smaller cursor is used.  It
    would be nice to be able to use the full cursor size, but xorg's interleaving
    stuff requires a cursor width that's a multiple of 32.  Thus, we're stuck
    back at 32x32 for cursor size, but we allocate enough memory for a 48x64
    cursor.
    
    This fixes misc interleaving corruption that we see with 2bpp cursors (when
    converting to ARGB).

    xf86-video-geode: change cursor size to match cimarron
    
    When we use ARGB cursors and rotate the screen, we get double cursors
    and stale cursor data left over.  This is because cimarron expects a
    cursor that is smaller than or equal to 48x64, but hardcodes a memory
    shift of 192 bytes (4*48).  This means that if we have a 32x64 cursor,
    cimarron screws it up.  Change the cursor size to 48x64.

    geode:  Unmap the PCI memory when we close the screen

    Fix build for git-master (missing device pointers).
    
    We don't have an updated Video ABI yet, so use the XINPUT ABI as check for
    when to use which call.
    
    Note that the check is not optimal. We only check for the position of the VCP,
    not of any other device to adjust the viewpoint. This needs to be fixed.

    Revert "Fix build (missing device pointers)."
    
    Silly me, this breaks the build for non-git-master servers.
    
    This reverts commit 3005e9c7eb10e212c956e87b3631548e268c794e.

    miPointerGetScreen, miPointerGetPosition and pScreen->SetCursorPosition all
    require a device argument now. For lack of other choices, just pass in the

    [GX][LX] Push PreInit fixes to avoid segfauls on X -configure.
    
    This is known to work on products with GeodeROM and Insyde BIOSes.
    
    On products with a General Software BIOS, a freeze occurs while X
    is probing VBE.  The same issue occurs with LinuxBIOS and VGAROM,
    but not with LinuxBIOS omitting VGAROM.
    
    Both issues appear to be caused by X server core upgrading from
    vm86 to x86emu since X server release 1.3, which requires fixing
    x86emu, or the concerned BIOSes, or both.

    the clip region changing and the width/height changing.

    Fix the upload / composite mask race
    
    We fix a race with the upload function when using a composite mask
    by using the exa core function exaGetPixmapFirstPixel, which does
    the right thing in X 1.4 and newer.  For older versions, the fix is
    to stall the pipeine to ensure the upload is complete, so thats what
    we do.

    Fix A8 masks
    
    We were using the wrong operation for A8 masks, resulting in badness.
    Also, clean up the mask blt to be much simpler.

    Use the correct pitch for composite mask operations
    
    We need to specify the correct pitch for composite mask operations - this
    fixes the stride problem.  Also, correctly set up the source color and
    some other minor issues, this helps us pass caps-join in the cairo test
    suite.

    fix the MSR hooks by moving the hook definitions where they will do some
    good and disabling the VSA method.

    [MAJOR UPDATE] Geode LX driver
    
    This is a major re-vamping of the Geode LX driver to support EXA, RandR,
    and advanced xserver features.  The GX and LX drivers now share the similar
    streamlined infrastructure, and acceleration.  The LX driver also adds
    features the GX does not have, such as accelerated rotations and
    far better composite support.
    
    This provides the basis for the rotation and acceleration enhancements.

    PATCH:  Avoid incorrectly killing the gamma RAM when the driver starts up
    
    The Xv driver requires color adjustment by programming the gamma LUT.  The

    for any previous applications that may have graphics gamma information in
    the LUT.  Change only applies the video adjustment when video is enabled.
