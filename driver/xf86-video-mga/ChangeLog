    xf86-video-mga: fix a lockup in the mga driver
    
    I've had a Xserver lockup in the mga driver, examining it with gdb showed
    this obviously broken loop:
    	count = INREG(MGAREG_VCOUNT) + 2;
    	while(INREG(MGAREG_VCOUNT) < count);
    
    It reads the line counter and waits until the counter advances by two. The
    cause of the lockup is this - if the kernel reschedules the Xorg process
    and lets it run in such a moment when INREG(MGAREG_VCOUNT) returns the
    maximum (or maximum minus 1) line count, the loop never exits.

    xf86-video-mga: set the pan_ctl register
    
    On my Matrox G550 most videomodes in Xorg didn't work. I found out that it
    works if Xorg pixel clock is similar to the pixel clock set on framebuffer
    console.
    
    Further analysis showed that the Linux framebuffer driver sets the pan_ctl
    register (the register 0xa2) according to the pixel clock, the Xorg driver
    doesn't set it.
    
    I copied the code to set the pan_ctl register from the Linux kernel to the
    Xorg driver, and most videomodes in Xorg work.
    
    The pan_ctl register is required for both analog and digital output.
    
    The pan_ctl register is saved and restored, this is required so that we
    restore text-mode screen or Linux framebuffer correctly.

    Fixed memory bandwidth limitation for G200eW to 318.77 Mhz.
    Added a workaround (blit 1x1 with rop=xor) to fix the black screen problem for G200eW.

    Do not adjust the destination blend factor if we need source alpha
    but our source doesn't have an alpha channel. This makes no sense at all,
    because the intermediate picture will always have alpha bits (either from
    the original source, or forced to 0xff).

    Makefile.am: fix ChangeLog hook
    Make ChangeLog hook safe for all situations I could think of, including
    carrying the ChangeLog through for distcheck when objdir != srcdir.  It's
    significantly more ugly, but eh.

    Register name tweak.
    
    The "DAC power down" register powers down the DAC when it's
    set to zero, and enables it when it's set to one.
    To avoid confusion, I renamed it.

Date:   Fri Oct 27 11:48:35 2006 -0700

    Convert tests of pMga->Chipset to tests of single bit flags.
    
    Several places in the driver contain if-statements that test Chipset against
    several different values to determine what functionality to use.  Some of
    these tests, HALCHIPSETS in particular, test as many as 6 different values.
    This bloats the code size unnecessarilly.  Instead we cache the results of
    some of those tests in single bit flags stored in pMga.
    
    These changes are similar to some changes in the pci-rework branch.

    Enable the BYPASS332 and NODITHER flags when writing to 8 bpp dests.
    
    Thanks to Ville Syrjälä, who noticed these were missing.
    Note that this messes up glyph compositing (A8 add A8) pretty much, but
    I don't know what's really going on there yet.

    More DUALSTAGE0 fixes related to A8 writes.
    
    When writing from a texture without an alpha channel to an A8 texture,
    we now set the alpha channel to 0xff via FCOL.

    Bug #7265: Fix MGA DRI locking.
    
    The server expects the driver to take the DRI lock in the wakeup
    handler, and release it in the block handler.
    The old locking scheme didn't work like this, which caused problems.
    We now no longer override wakeup/block handler and just use the ones
    provided by the server. This means the DRI lock will be taken
    "all the time" and not just when it's needed by the driver.
    MGADRISwapContext* are activated again, so the wakeup handler could be
    removed.
    I didn't notice any DRI performance drop, but I didn't do serious
    benchmarking either.

    Famous last words: "This last change is so trivial, I don't even need to

        the multi-line X_ERROR message into multiple xf86DrvMsg calls to get
        the formating correct in the log. However, I didn't bother to put in
        the correct punctuation when I did so.

    PInS data on later cards (G200 and later) contains information about the
        physical bus used for the card. This allows accurate detection of PCI
        cards that use a PCI-to-PCI bridge with an AGP chip.
    Correctly disable DRI on PCI cards used with pre-3.2 DRM. Previously the
        test was performed based on PCI ID (see above for why this is wrong)
        and was done *before* the DRM version was known.
    Bug #3759: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3759> Correctly
        determine the PLL reference frequency from the PInS data. Previously
        the wrong bit was tested. Blame the dumb programmer that used
        cut-and-paste (that would be me).

    Re-write the PInS processing code
    This patch dumps all of the old BIOS processing code from the MGA DDX. The
        new code, located in mga_bios.c, is modeled after the code in
        matroxfb_misc.c (though no actual code was copied). Basically, the BIOS
        is processed in one place, with "device independent" values stored in a
        data structure. This data is then used, without extra switch-statments,
        throughout the driver.
    In addition, this patch adds support for processing the BIOS on PowerPC
        systems. On PPC cards, the magic offset values (that give the location
        of the PInS data) is not in the BIOS. Instead the driver has to search
        the BIOS for the PInS structure signature. The patch does this and
        correctly handles byte-ordering (and data alignement) issues.
    This code has been tested on an AGP G400 on x86 and a PCI G450 on PowerPC.
    NOTE: The file mga_bios.h is also removed. The "documentation" in that file
        was moved to the file mga_PInS.txt. This file documents, as much as
        possible, the layout of the various PInS datastructure versions. The
        information in that file is 100% based on the old mga_bios.h and the
        code in matroxfb_misc.c. No additional information from Matrox
        documentation is included in that file. This just puts the information
        that was already known in one place.

    Adds support for MGA DRM version 3.2.
    Update MGA DDX to use new features of MGA DRM ersion 3.2 to enable DRI
        support on PCI cards. Backwards compatability with older client-side
        drivers is enabled with new Device section settings. See mga.man for
        details.

    Numerous comments, clean-ups, and refactorings for the DRI portion of the
        MGA driver.
    - Use mga_drm.h instead of mga_common.h. Due to this, all the MGA-specific
        DRM names were changed to generic versions (i.e., drmMGALock became
        drm_lock_t).
    - Merge MGADRIMapInit into MGADRIAGPInit and rename the resulting function
        MGADRIBootstrapDMA.
    - Eliminate several unnecessary drmMap calls. The server has no need to map
        MMIO space, primary DMA buffer space, secondary DMA buffer space, WARP
        microcode space, or the DRM status page.
    - Clarified which portions of the client / server DRI interface are no
        longer used.
    - Removed some unused fields from MGADRIServerPrivateRec.
    - Bump MGA_PATCHLEVEL.
