    Added "StartMouseEnabled" and "StartKeysEnabled" options
    
    With the disable-mouse and disable-keys button mapping the event generation can be toggled.
    These two options will start X with the event generation already disabled, so it can be
    enabled later with the appropriate button mapping. Default: Event generation is enabled.

    Added AutoRepeat option to specify rate and delay for key events.
    
    So far the autorepeat settings of xorg were used, thus sharing the settings with all other keyboard. This is still the default but the
    rate and delay can be changed per device, not conflicting with the settings of other keyboards.

    Integrated XStringToKeysym from libX11 in the module.
    
    To look up Keysyms from Strings the method XStringToKeysym comes in handy, which would
    require linking against libX11. By integrating the method in the module, this can be
    avoided until similar functionallity get's included in xorg-server.

    Readded own keymap for Joystick keys. This changes meaning of key, keylow and
    keyhigh values in xorg.conf from scancodes to keysyms!
    
    New xorg-server 1.4 fixes a lot of keyboard things. This makes it necessary to
    provide an own mapping rather than using the mapping of the current keyboard. A
    keymap is built dynamically from the options provided. The options now need to
    provide a keysym for each button instead of the scancodes of another keyboard
    attached keyboard.

    Key autorepeat added for axes with mode=relative
    
    If axis is set to relative and keylow and keyhigh are assigned, autorepeat for these keys is emulated with a speed relative to the
    value of the axis (keydown and keyup are generated frequently). A factor for this autorepeat speed can be assigned by
    "axis=<factor>key".
    If mode is "accelerated", the axis behaves like a button: only one keydown and one keyup, X does autorepeat for the key.

    Fixed button mapping to an axis needing amplify value.
    
    Button mapping without amplify value like "axis=x" used uninitialized value for amplify,
    making an amplify value mandatory. With no amplify value, 1.0 is assumed.

    Move subpixel movement from global to per axis/button.
    
    Instead of using one global subpixel variable for all axes and buttons, the axis/button
    struct for each axis/button holds it's own subpixel variable. This is neccessary to
    implement mapping of relative axes to keys, which needs to save own "subpixel" values.

    Added "keylow" and "keyhigh" option to axes, which generates key events when the axis is moved.
    
    One can specify scancodes for negative and positive axis movement. When the axis is moved out of the deadzone,
    keydown events are once generated, and keyrelease events are generated when the axis returns to 0.
    One can map a pad to the four arrow keys to play games that do not support a joystick.

    Typo in linux_jstk.c: Info about number of axes and buttons was interchanged

commit 7676d3c519a9190e3c7f9ed2c9abec8e95752c36
Author: Sascha Hlusiak <saschahlusiak@arcor.de>
Date:   Sat Apr 7 14:10:01 2007 -0400

    Fixed wrong type in ioctl call for detecting buttons and axes
    
    The ioctl call for reading the number of buttons and axes expects an unsigned char as parameter,
    not an int. Worked in Linux but not in FreeBSD. Changed to unsigned char though and added a check,
    if buttons and axes are more than MAXBUTTONS/MAXAXES.

        <X11/extensions/foo.h> for extension headers, e.g. Xv.h;
    change "foo.[ch]" to <X11/Xtrans/foo.[ch]> for Xtrans files.
