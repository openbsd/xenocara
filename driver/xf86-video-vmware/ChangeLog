    config: add AM_PROG_CC_C_O for per-target compilation flags
    
    The use of per-target compilation flags with C sources requires
    that the macro AM_PROG_CC_C_O be called from configure.ac
    
    If the C compiler does not accept the -c and -o options simultaneously,
    define NO_MINUS_C_MINUS_O. This macro actually tests both the compiler
    found by AC_PROG_CC, and, if different, the first cc in the path.
    The test fails if one fails. This macro was created for GNU Make
    to choose the default C compilation rule.

    fix a cursor refcounting bug, leading to segfaults
    
    this is similar to what xf86_use_hw_cursor() does, which is replaced by
    vmwareUseHWCursor (otherwise, the refcount could reach zero and hence the
    cursor deallocated while xf86CursorEnableDisableFBAccess() could still bring
    it back to life from the saved cursor).
    It is probably insane to do refcounting here, but this needs a xserver fix,
    and even if that's fixed this fix here shouldn't hurt (though would be
    unnecessary).

        An imperfect fix for Xinerama state changes without a mode change
    
        This patch improves behaviour for Xinerama state changes (via the
        VMWARE_CTRL) extension that don't have an accompanying mode change.
        This will be the case if a new Xinerama monitor layout has a bounding
        box with an identical size to that of the previous layout.
    
        Prior to this patch, the behaviour was pretty bad. If you sent two
        Xinerama states with the same bounding box, the second state would
        be set as pending but no actual mode change would occur, because
        the X server would already be in the right video mode. This means
        that the pending mode stays pending.
    
        If another Xinerama state comes in after this, we would hit our
        "Aborting due to existing pending state" error, and the new state
        would be discarded. This means we'd drop the mode switch on the
        floor, plus we'd lie to the client and say it worked.
    
        One example of the user-visible symptoms from this: The user has
        four monitors of the same size. We'll call them A through D.
        The VM goes into full-screen mode, and they set it to use screens
        ABC. Now they switch to BCD. These have the same bounding box size,
        so no mode change occurs and a topology is still pending. Now they
        switch to monitors BC. This mode switch is dropped, so the guest
        is still in the ABC topology and the mode is too wide for BC.
    
        This patch is an incomplete fix. If we're setting a new topology
        with the same bounding box, we'll flush the Xinerama state
        immediately since we know the mode switch will never occur. This
        means we don't get stuck with xineramaNextState set when it
        shouldn't be, and we don't have the problem with dropping
        subsequent mode changes. We also do set the new Xinerama state,
        so apps that query it will see the updated state immediately.
    
        But the fix isn't perfect- as far as I can tell, there's no way
        to notify applications that the monitor layout changed without
        a mode switch. So even though we've set the new topology, most
        apps won't notice. There are ways we could hack around this,
        but none of them are pretty.

    Fix black screen after resume from hibernate.
    
    The root cause for the black screen and system lock up is
    caused by not recovering the SVGA ID register after hibernation.
    Incorrect ID register value will invalidate the FIFO memory start
    register, and driver will not retrieve correct FIFO memory start
    address and the busy read of svga FIFO sync register will lock up
    the whole system.
    
    Currently SVGA Xorg driver does not have a kernel module to handle
    the power management event, but Xorg will call driver provided
    LeaveVT before shutting down system and call EnterVT after resuming
    system from hibernation, so these two callback functions are good
    entry points to save and restore the ID register value. This patch
    saves the ID register value in LeaveVT and restores the value to
    SVGA ID register in EnterVT.

    Fix dynamic mode edge cases
    
    The VMware Xorg driver supports dynamic modelines that can be set from
    userspace via an X extension. These are used to implement VM features
    which need to automatically change the resolution of the guest OS.
    
    This driver implements the feature using two modelines.  The driver
    would alternately update one mode then the other, so that in typical
    usage one mode is current and the other is available for the next mode
    switch.
    
    This usually worked, but there were many edge cases that could cause
    this alternating pattern to get 'out of sync', so we'd end up changing
    the resolution of the current video mode. This could end up putting
    the X server in a state where the screen resolution has been changed,
    but the hardware was never reprogrammed for the new resolution.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by explicitly searching for a dynamic

    Automatically add modelines for the driver's built-in set of modes.
    
    The driver has had a built-in set of modes for a while, but there
    was nothing adding modelines to back them up, causing initial modes
    to be rejected at startup with certain Xorg versions.
    
    This change adds the actual modelines for sufficiently new versions
    of the server (>= 1.2), as the necessary calls were only introduced
    at that time.

    Add RegionEqual function for older XFree86 versions.
    
    Fixes bug : http://bugzilla.eng.vmware.com/show_bug.cgi?id=312853
    
    When we added AUTOPAINT_COLORKEY capability to our VMware video driver,
    region functions were used to keep track of colorkey painting.
    
    REGION_EQUAL was one of them.
    
    Unfortunately REGION_EQUAL was not present in regionstr.h shipped with XFree86 version
    4.3.0.
    This version is used by TurboLinux 10; causing X server to crash while playing videos.
    
    REGION_EQUAL was added in revision 1.8 of regionstr.h and available for xfree86 version
    4.3.99
    onwards.
    Reference:
    http://cvsweb.xfree86.org/cvsweb/xc/programs/Xserver/include/regionstr.h.diff?r1=1.7&r2=1.8
    
    When I compiled the existing code(without my change), I see a warning was generated
    indicating REGION_EQUAL is not present.
    Too bad we missed it.
    
    This patch includes
    1) Slightly modified version of miRegionEqual from miRegion.c
    2) Some formating cleanup.

    Video Overlay: Handle clipping correctly with AutoPaint colorkey.
    
    We recently added XV_AUTOPAINT_COLORKEY attribute to the X video driver
    to enable applications like Real player that rely on this attribute to
    display video frames in Linux guest.
    
    When this attribute is SET, we paint the colorkey on 1st frame and from
    there on only when the video is moved.
    
    This introduced a bug 305202 with clipping.
    
    Consider a case when the video is playing, obscure the player window
    with another window, without moving the player window, move the other
    window away. The part of the window that was obscured didn't display
    the video.
    
    With this patch instead of relying on the target rectangle, we use
    the clipBoxes supplied in every frame.

    Video Overlay: Add XV_AUTOPAINT_COLORKEY capability to the Xv extension of Linux guest driver.
    
    Applications use XV_AUTOPAINT_COLORKEY capability to let the driver handle the painting
    of colorkey.
    
    Real Player assumes this capability as ON by default and hence prior to this patch videos
    didn't play with Real player.
    
    With this patch:
    a) If AUTOPAINT_COLORKEY is SET then the driver handles the painting of the colorkey.
    Painting is done on the 1st frame and from there on only if the video frame moves.
    
    b) Adds UYVY fourcc format to keep it consistent with Windows SVGA driver and the host backends.
    
    c) Changes the default colorkey from a pungent GREEN to a darker shade.
    Real Player sets this colorkey and it looks better when the video is moved around.

    Fix video overlay offscreen allocation bug
    
    When Kaffeine player stops a video, it sets the cleanup flag to FALSE and may
    start playing the next video. In its present state the driver does not check or
    clean up the offscreen area. This is a bug as the newer video might need more
    offscreen space for its frame. The fix is to check for the offscreen frame size
    in videoPlay and restart the stream if necessary.

    Fix a race condition when switching to a multihead fullscreen mode.
    
    Due to implemtation details on the host side, switching to a multihead
    fullscreen mode means multiple mode changes along the way. However,
    because rrSetScreenConfig returns before the mode change completes,
    we can enter a race, where a subsequent SetDisplayTopology overrides
    the current pending one, leading to a mode switch where the resolution
    and topology are no longer consistent.
    
    So, we fix this by ignoring any attempts to set the pending topology if
    one is already pending.

        of useful versions in the driver so that users don't
        have to mess with their config files as often.

    Remove XAA 'acceleration'.
    
    We have a lot of stale code to 'accelerate' certain operations
    through XAA. However, in practice, this acceleration is
    completely unhelpful because whenever we encounter an
    unaccelerated action, we have to sync and flush the fifo
    which kills any performance gain.
    
    As such, the virtual hardware doesn't even advertise these
    acceleration capabilities anymore, so the code is completely
    unusued.
    
    In addition, XAA is on the way out, so there's no point
    leaving in dead code which will have to go in the fairly
    near future.
    
    The one operation we can meaningfully accelerate is a
    front-only fill and when we get around to implementing
    that, we'll use EXA instead.

    the maximum width/height reported by the virtual hardware which
    is configured on the host side.

    Add xinerama support to the vmware video driver. (Better late than never).
    
    With this change, the VMWARE_CTRL extension is updated so that it can
    receive topology updates at runtime. I will add some sample client code
    separately.
    
    I also intend to add support for a static initial topology defined in
    xorg.conf but I haven't got around to it yet due to hating to write
    string parsing code.

    is deprecated but support is retained so the driver works with
    Workstation 5.5 and friends.
