 * This is the main file used to add Durango graphics support to a software 
 * project.  The main reason to have a single file include the other files
 * is that it centralizes the location of the compiler options.  This file
 * should be tuned for a specific implementation, and then modified as needed
 * for new Durango releases.  The releases.txt file indicates any updates to
 * this main file, such as a new definition for a new hardware platform. 
 *
 * In other words, this file should be copied from the Durango source files
 * once when a software project starts, and then maintained as necessary.  
 * It should not be recopied with new versions of Durango unless the 
 * developer is willing to tune the file again for the specific project.
