    tools: make install fails when user has no write permission in /lib
    
    The location of the udevdir is obtained from pkg-config. This is generally
    /lib/udev. Most people run their build scripts as non-root and do not want to
    overwrite or add files on their workstation system.
    
    This was not the behaviour in release 12.8.0. The code in configure.ac set
    udevdir based on common installation prefixes /usr or /usr/local for which
    the user would probably have root permission anyway. Other prefixes would
    be assigned a udevdir value under the given $prefix.
    
    The patch proposes the default location $libdir/udev/rules.d and no longer
    seeking it's value from pkg-config, just like what was done for hal.
    
    The expectation is that the xorg source tree can be built from top to bottom
    out of the box without tweaks or workarounds. A developer need to
    manually install a rule under development and run an admin command for it to
    take effect. Unlike binaries or libraries, there is no "path" style
    variable to append a rule in development from a different location.

    "make dist" fails when workstation has no udev package
    
    Unable to create a tar file for the vmmouse package or run distcheck for that
    matter. In tools, when the dev package is not installed, the makefile code
    under HAS_UDEV_RULES_DIR is commented out. That leaves $(udev_DATA) empty
    which causes EXTRA_DIST to be missing a file.
    
    The solution is to spell out the file name. The name can never change as the
    content of the tarball must be the same for everyone creating a tar file from
    git, regardless of their workstation configuration.

    This reverts commit 189dc266a66485d48303acbc1a4fbe4642c75e9f.
    
    It seems that for some reason the device routing is breaking with this.
    Possibly related to Win7 x64 hosts because it's not reproducible on
    GNU/Linux hosts. Semantially we'd still like to match only on mouse
    kernel but for the time being this seems to cause more problems
    than it solves. Hence the revert.

    Only match against event[0-9] in udev rules
    
    It looks like the udev rule was matched against two devices which caused
    the driver to be loaded twice. We shouldn't match against the other
    device because it will very seldom send bogus events. Some of the bug
    this caused was buttons getting stuck.

    provided to try and make sure the driver will be loaded automatically in a
    compatible VM also if the X server uses udev instead of HAL.
    
    The configure script tries to determine if and where it makes sense to install

    This reverts commit 93f032b80b841e1b6beeff814e8d9519e485fdef.
    
    I'm doing this for now because qemu (with and without kvm) provides
    an implementation of the vmmouse device and input hotplug works there
    right now. Later, I'll try and dig up an equivalent id check for them.

    Add HAL integration to support input hot plug.
    
     * vmmouse_detect: A simple program that detects whether a vmmouse
       device is present.
     * hal-probe-vmmouse: A HAL callout script that uses vmmouse_detect
       and overrides input.x11_driver.
     * 11-x11-vmmouse.fdi: fdi descriptor that adds the callout for PS/2
       mice.
    
    Additional 'configure' variables have been added to allow for overriding
    HAL paths, although this shouldn't usually be necessary.

    Don't call conversion_proc for older Xservers
    
    There was a bug in the Xserver for a while when it didn't call a driver's
    conversion_proc to convert device space coordinates to screen space. To fix
    this, vmmouse starting calling that method (since January), but if this is done
    on older versions of X, the conversion gets done twice.
    
    The fix is to add a configure check for the right versions of X and call
    VMMouseConvertProc() only if we are compiling against an X that has the bug.
    
    There's some whitespace cleanup for vmmouse.c too.

    - Makes the driver compile againt older versions of X (tested upto 4.3).
    - Bump up the version number in configure.ac and the modinfo section.
    - A couple of trivial whitespace cleanups.

    Fix device to screen space coordinate conversion
    
    The Xserver no longer calls an input device's conversion_proc to convert x and
    y coordinates from device to screen space. This fix calls the conversion
    routine in vmmouse.c before posting the motion event to Xserver.
    
    Other drivers also seem to rely on conversion_proc, so the real fix should probably
    go into Xserver's code (maybe in xserver/hw/xfree86/common/xf86Xinput.c?).

    Under certain circumstances, typically when the kernel PS/2 driver decides
    to reset the PS/2 device, we can find ourselves in an inconsistent state
    between the vmmouse driver and the virtual hardware. When this is encountered,
    we should re-request absolute mode from the hardware to get back in sync.
