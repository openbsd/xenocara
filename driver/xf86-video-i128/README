  [1m1.  Supported hardware[0m

  The current accelerated I128 server supports


  +o  Imagine 128 (I128 with Texas Instruments TVP3025 or IBM528 RAMDAC).
     It has been tested with with 4MB of VRAM.

  +o  Imagine 128 Ticket 2 Ride (I128-T2R with IBM526 or 528 RAMDAC). It
     has been tested with 4 MB and 8 MB of VRAM and DRAM.

  +o  Imagine 128 Revolution 3D (I128-R3D with IBM526 RAMDAC).  It has
     been tested with 4 MB, 8 MB, and 16 MB of WRAM or SGRAM.

  +o  Imagine 128 Revolution IV (I128-R4 with SILVERHAMMER RAMDAC).  It
     has been tested with 32 MB.


  [1m2.  Features:[0m


  +o  uses linear frame buffer

  +o  Resolutions up to the maximum supported by the card should be
     possible.

  +o  8 bpp, 16 bpp (depth 15 and 16), and 32 bpp (depth 24, sparse) are
     supported.

  +o  supports RGB Sync-on-Green

  +o  Makes use of the graphics accelerator.


  [1m3.  Configuration:[0m

  The I128 driver should auto-detect all supported hardware so you
  needn't have anything other than the Identifier in the Section
  "Device" of the xorg.conf file.  When running the xorgcfg or
  xorgconfig programs one merely needs to select an I128 card so that
  the correct server will be used.  One need not and should not specify
  a RAMDAC, clockchip or allow the setup program to probe for clocks.
  The driver will auto-detect the amount of video ram present.

  The following Section "Device" options are supported by the I128
  driver:

  +o  Option "Dac6Bit"

     Will enable 6-bit DAC support.

  +o  Option "NoAccel"

     Will disable all hardware acceleration.

  +o  Option "SyncOnGreen"

     Will enable syncing on green for sync-on-green monitors (these are
     typically fixed frequency workstation monitors).
