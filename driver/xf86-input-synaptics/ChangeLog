    Add a delay between the second button down-up event of double taps
    
    Some applications ignore the second tap of double taps because of the
    lack of a delay between the button down and button up events.
    
    Prevent this by replacing the transition from TS_2B to TS_START with a
    transition from TS_2B to TS_SINGLETAP that emits only a button down
    event. The button up event will be emitted when transitioning from
    TS_SINGLETAP to TS_START.
    
    In addition, decrease the default value of MaxDoubleTapTime from 180 ms
    to 100 ms in order to make double taps faster.

    eventcomm: ensure we're on the same clock as the server
    
    Default on evdev devices is CLOCK_REALTIME. If that clock falls behind the
    server's CLOCK_MONOTONIC, motion after a clickpad click may be delayed by the
    difference in the clocks.
    
    In detail:
    When the timer func is triggered, GetTimeInMillis() which is CLOCK_MONOTONIC,
    is stored as hwState->millis. The eventcomm backend uses struct
    input_event time (CLOCK_REALTIME).
    
    When we read events from the device, if the evdev time is less than the server
    time, the fix for (#48777) sets the current event time to hwState->millis.
    Until the evdev time overtakes that stored time, all events have the
    hwState->millis time.
    
    If during that time a clickpad triggers a physical click,
    clickpad_click_millis is set to hwState->millis + the ignore-motion timeout.
    Thus, all motion is ignored until the event time overtakes that stored
    time.
    
    The whole issue is further enhanced by us unconditionally setting the timer
    func if we get any events, which is a separate issue anyway.

    Prevent two-finger taps from being ignored
    
    When two fingers are used, the coordinates of only one of them is taken into
    account. This can lead to sudden variations of the absolute coordinates when
    two-fingers taps are performed if the finger considered changes.
    
    Take into account coordinates variations to prevent unwanted taps only if
    the number of fingers doesn't change.

    conf: increase top software button area to 15%
    
    We had reports that the top software button area is hard to hit for those
    using the trackpoint and clicking the buttons with their thumb.
    
    Analysis of event recordings (3 different people) for left, right and middle
    clicks shows that there is a significant amount of events up to about 10mm
    (with outliers up to 12mm) from the top of the touchpad. That maps to 15%.
    
    Interestingly, the middle button does not seem to need this, presumably the
    haptic feedback of the little dots sticking out from the surface make hitting
    the button easier. Its size is increased to 15% anyway, for simplicity and
    because a sample set of 3 is too small to be definitive about this.

    Add support for INPUT_PROP_TOPBUTTONPAD
    
    Add a HasSecondaryButtons boolean config option which defaults to true for
    devices with the INPUT_PROP_TOPBUTTONPAD and false for all other devices.
    
    Only parse the SecondarySoftButtonAreas when this option is true, effectively
    disabling the top buttons when it is false. Likewise, only initialize the
    SecondarySoftButtonAreas property if we enable support for it.
    
    This means that it is now safe to always set a SecondarySoftButtonAreas
    default in 50-synaptics.conf, and that he section which was intended for
    use with future pnp-id matching can be dropped, as that is now all handled
    in the kernel.
    
    While at also remove the comment about disabling the bottom edge area, as that
    is now done automatically.

    Always count tripletap + click as 3 fingerclick on pads with < 3 touches
    
    When trying to do a 3 fingerclick on a touchpad which only tracks 2 touches,
    this may register as a 3 or 2 fingerclick depending on the order in which
    the touchpad detects the fingers. If the 2 outer fingers of the 3 get seen
    first, then the 2 touches will be too far apart for the heuristic to see
    them as being close together, and the click gets counted as a 2 finger click.
    
    A user will likely never do a 2 finger click with a 3th finger resting
    somewhere else on the pad, where-as the above misdetection of the clicks is
    a real issue, so simply always count a click with trippletap set as a
    3 finger click on pads which track less then 3 touches.

    eventcomm: Hook up the libevdev log handler
    
    This is a bit problematic: libevdev only has one global log handler.
    So if we have another driver use libevdev, we'll either overwrite that handler
    or get overwritten, whichever comes first. So we need to re-set the handler
    every time we get an event to make sure we log through our handler.
    Likewise, if we ever drop the device, we need to unset the log handler back to
    NULL because we may unload the module and our handler may disappear.
    
    Use the lowest logging priority, let the server filter based on the verbosity
    level instead.

    If the touchpad is in TOUCHPAD_OFF mode, allow physical clicks
    
    Enabling clicks in off mode also allows for the new Lenovo *40 series to use
    the top software buttons while the touchpad is disabled. This benefits those
    that usually disable touchpads altogether but still need the buttons for the
    trackstick.
    
    This changes existing behaviour, but TouchpadOff was always intended to stop
    erroneous events while typing. Physical button presses are hard to trigger
    accidentally. On the touchpads that TouchpadOff concept was originally
    designed for the buttons are nowhere near the keyboard and are physically
    separated from the touchpad anyway. On Clickpads, triggering a physical
    click requires more force than accidentally touching the surface.

    Don't allow any type of movement starting in the top softbutton area
    
    Clicking in the top soft button area causes the trackpad to begin
    registering motion, even if the finger never leaves the top soft button
    area. We don't want this kind of behavior for the top soft button area,
    since it makes clicking and dragging items much more difficult when
    using a pointing stick.

    Add property support for secondary (top) software buttons
    
    This was originally intended as a fixed xorg.conf option only (and still
    largely is seen as such). Secondary software button are required only on a specific series
    of touchpads and should be pre-configured by the system and/or the
    distribution. As such, the property will not be initialized if it is not set
    in the xorg.conf and will thus not respond to runtime changes.
    
    Exposing the property in this way gives clients a chance of detecting if a top
    software button area is present and thus adjust their behaviour accordingly.

    Wait for *new* coordinates on a clickpad click before reporting the click
    
    It is possible for a click to get reported before any related touch events
    get reported, here is the relevant part of an evemu-record session on a T440s:

    E: 5.133422 0000 0000 0000	# ------------ SYN_REPORT (0) ----------
    
    Notice the BTN_LEFT event all by itself!
    
    If this happens, it may lead to the following problem scenario:
    -touch the touchpad in its right click area
    -let go of the touchpad
    -rapidly click in the middle area, so that BTN_LEFT gets reported before the
     new coordinates (such as seen in the trace above, this may require some
     practicing with evemu-record to reproduce)
    -the driver registers the click as a right click because it uses the
     old coordinates from the cumulative coordinates to determine the
     click location
    
    This commit fixes this by:
    1) Resetting the cumulative coordinates not only when no button is pressed,
       but also when there is no finger touching the touchpad, so that when
       we do get a touch the cumulative coordinates start at the right place
    2) Delaying processing the BTN_LEFT down transition if there is no finger
       touching the touchpad
    
    This approach has one downside, if we wrongly identify a touchpad as
    a clickpad, then the left button won't work unless the user touches the
    touchpad while clicking the left button.
    
    If we want we can fix this by doing something like this:
    1) Making update_hw_button_state return a delay; and
    2) Tracking that we've delayed BTN_LEFT down transition processing; and
    3) When we've delayed BTN_LEFT down transition return a small delay value; and
    4) If when we're called again we still don't have a finger down, just
       treat the click as a BTN_LEFT
    
    But this is not worth the trouble IMHO, the proper thing to do in this
    scenario is to fix the mis-identification of the touchpad as a clickpad.

    On button down update cumulative to current x and y, instead of previous
    
    When a button click and new coordinates get reported in one go we sync the
    cumulative coordinates to the old x and y, rather then the newly reported ones.
    
    This keeping of the old coordinates causes the following issue:
    -touch the touchpad in its right click area
    -let go of the touchpad
    -rapidly click in the left click area (or middle area), so that the
     new location and the click get reported in one syn (may require some
     practicing with evemu-record to reproduce)
    -the driver registers the click as a right click because it uses the
     old coordinates from the cumulative coordinates to determine the

    Unless the motion has started outside the soft-button area.
    
    Note that we must start reporting motions regardless of whether we think we're
    in the button area or not as soon as we've switched to using cumulative
    coordinates, since then the coordinates are no longer absolute.
    
    This fixes the reporting of unintended motion just before a click in a soft

    Add another third state to TouchpadOff for disabling all but button clicks
    
    On a new set of laptops like the Lenovo T440 the trackstick does not have
    physical buttons. Instead, the touchpad's top edge is supposed to acts
    software button area. To avoid spurious cursor jumps when the trackstick is in
    use and the finger is resting on the touchpad, add another mode that disables
    motion events.
    
    Enabled by syndaemon with -t click-only, the default stays unchanged. No
    specific integration with the traditional disable-while-typing is needed. On
    such touchpads, disabling motion events is sufficient to avoid spurious
    events and we don't want to stop HW buttons to send events.
    
    Note that this only adds the new state to the driver and to syndaemon, there
    is nothing hooked up otherwise to actually monitor the trackstick.
    
    Special note for syndaemon: optional arguments are a GNU extension, so work
    around it by messing with an optstring starting with ":" which allows us to
    manually parse the options.

    Add secondary (top) software buttons area
    
    New generation of laptops with trackstick do not have physical buttons
    associated with the trackstick, but instead rely on software buttons at
    the top of the clickpad.
    Adding a secondary software button area for this purpose.
    As we're likely detecting the devices that need it based on udev tags
    and MatchTag configuration items, this area doesn't need to be exposed
    through properties. So static configuration is fine.

    Allow using the entire touchpad for motions started inside the active area
    
    synaptics offers an option to make parts of the touchpad insensitive. This
    is ie useful to do palm avoidance rather then palm detection (which may be
    unreliable) by disabling an area of 15% on the right and left side of the
    touchpad.
    
    Currently a motion which has started inside the active area, stops as soon
    as it moves outside of the active area.
    
    If a motion started inside the active area and thus has already generated some
    move events, this makes no sense. If the user moves outside of the active
    area in this case, this is very likely because the user wants to continue
    the motion.
    
    This commit allows such motions to continue normally.
    
    I would like to thank Juerd Waalboer for the basic idea, some coding and lots
    of testing for this fix.

    Switch to libevdev for the eventcomm backend
    
    This has a potential bug that would need to be fixed in mtdev first:
    if we get a SYN_DROPPED and we miss out on events, the current code emulates a
    normal EV_SYN, feeds that to mtdev and hopes that that fills the mtdev output
    queue.
    
    If mtdev doesn't generate events on that EV_SYN, we're stuck in limbo and may
    get weird results. The loop will continue and sync the device, but there's the
    off chance we get odd events.

    Allow soft button areas to overlap on the edge
    
    For percent-based configuration in the form of
    middle button 33%-66%, right button 66%-0 we'd get an error because of the
    one device unit overlap. This was neither documented nor useful, because
    leaving a 1% gap leaves an actual gap between the buttons. Allow for an
    overlap of one device unit on the edge of the buttons.
    
    What's picked in that case depends on the implementation of
    is_inside_softbutton_area but since one device unit is so small, it doesn't
    matter.

    conf: add example for AreaBottomEdge on clickpad buttons
    
    Those that use clickpad buttons as buttons can see cursor jumps as the press
    on the touchpad - largely caused by the finger changing shape as the
    pressure changes and thus moving the hotspot.
    
    Simple fix is to define the clickpad soft button areas as dead areas, but
    this cannot be set as general option as it would break for those that use
    tapping.

    mtdev_close_delete() is to mtdev_new_open() as mtdev_close() is to
    mtdev_open().  So, since we're using mtdev_new_open(), we need to use
    mtdev_close_delete() instead of just mtdev_close() to actually free
    everything.
    
    Fixes an eventual failure to open the touchpad device after a lot of
    suspend/resume cycles.

    Allow dead areas to update the button state
    
    On clickpads, a dead area helps prevent pointer movement when the buttons
    are pressed. Thus check for the button state before resetting the hw state
    in case we get a right-click in the soft button area.
    
    For clickfinger, the effect is that clickfinger events are now triggered if
    the finger rests in the dead area.

    Reset num_active_touches on DeviceOff (#52496)
    
    When disabling the device, reset num_active_touches to zero. Otherwise,
    num_active_touches stays at the value it was on DeviceOff(). Future touches
    add to that value until the index may go past priv->open_slots[].
    That causes spurious memory corruption on touch ends.
    
    And as of 55fc42e7c9b4948cadd4f98ef7b6a3b12e268e3e we ignore pre-existing
    touches anyway.
    
    Test-case:
    - place num_touches fingers on the touchpad
    - xinput disable <device>
    - lift fingers
    - xinput enable <device>
    - place finger on device, num_active_touches is now (num_touches + 1)

    Reset hw->x/y to INT_MIN and skip HandleState until we have x/y events
    
    The driver assumes x/y is always valid but after coming from a resume we may
    get a few events with either ABS_X or ABS_Y (not both). Thus we process with
    hw->x == 0 and hw->y == somevalue, causing cursor jumps when calculating
    deltas whenver the real hw->x comes in.
    
    Fix this by resetting hw->x/y to INT_MIN and skip state processing until
    both axes are available.
    
    For clickpads, this means handling of data will be delayed until we get
    at least one motion on each axis. Button presses won't be recognised either
    until that happens. It requires some skill to not trigger motion on both
    axes, even more to press a button without doing so.
    
    For non-clickpads, handling of motion events will be delayed likewise. If a
    physical button is pressed immediately after resume we have to assume deltas
    of x/y.
    - If the next event is a new touch, it will have ABS_X/ABS_Y set anyway
    - If the finger was already down, a button event is generated, and the
      finger has generated ABS_X or ABS_Y only before the event, the next event
      containing the missing data will cause a jump. The fix for this is more
      invasive and this is quite a corner-case.

    The open slots array is used for clickpad cumulative delta computation.
    If the array is not reset and becomes corrupted during the device

    as jumpy cursor behavior on some clickpads after suspend/resume.

    Ignore pre-existing touches
    
    If a touch is physically active when the device is enabled, then all
    events for that touch must be ignored. In particular, we cannot close
    the touch or we will decrement touch count counters below zero. If these
    counters go below zero memory corruption can occur.
    
    Note that a device is disabled and enabled every time the user types on
    the keyboard if synclient is used to disable the trackpad while typing.
    This is a very common option.

    CoastingSpeed is defined as scrolls/s. The previous code just used

    Divide the estimated delta by the scroll distance to get the accurate
    scrolls/s number. Since that now changes the contents of what's in
    coast_speed_y, change the users of that too.

    We only have the current button state and we mess with it, so the conditions
    for a possible clickpad soft-button event are:
    - hw->left is down now
    - none of left|right|middle were down before. since we change hw->left to
      hw->right/left we need to check all three
    
    If hw->left is down but one of the other buttons was already down, copy that
    button state and continue.

    Fix coasting friction
    
    As a result of commit 5a1612d4496b51682c9043aa064025c545249de6, coasting speed
    was bumped up to a different scale by removing the divisor during the
    calculation of initial coasting speed. This caused coasting friction to have
    little to no effect, resulting in coasting that lasted virtually forever using
    the default coasting friction value of 50.
    
    This patch multiplies the scroll_dist_{horiz,vert} which was previously used as
    a divisor for initial coasting speed to the coasting friction before deducting
    it at each step, thus bringing coasting friction back under control.

    Stop coasting when two-finger scroll begins
    
    There is currently a problem that can lead the coasting to continue while scrolling in a particular situation :
    with
     Option "VertTwoFingerScroll" "on"
     Option "CornerCoasting" "0"
     Option "CoastingSpeed" "10"
     Option "CoastingFriction" "50"
     Option "CornerCoasting" "0"
    If you scroll down with two finger then raise a finger, coasting will start. But if you put down that finger and try to
    scroll up, the inertia will still scroll down while you scroll up. This can look like a very particular situation, but
    happens to me often while scrolling in a big document.
    
    This (awfully simple) patch stop coasting when detecting two-finger scroll.

    Use maximum number of touches reported by evdev
    
    This resolves a regression from da461b91659d0c64aa6827e065aee2682116a57e
    where three touch tap and click actions on certain devices no longer
    work.
    
    Some devices report a higher touch count than the number of touches they
    can provide data for. For example, many Synaptics touchpads can report
    up to five touches, but only provide data for two of them. We need to be
    able to report the correct number of touches for these devices when
    there are three touches. Using the maximum of the reported touch count
    and the number of touches provided ensures the count is accurate for all
    device types.

    (Use the scroll distances as increment for scrolling valuator axes)
    
    Since this commit, scroll distance was set with SetScrollValuator function
    but it was still used as a divisor to calculate coasting,
    thus making coasting too slow. (at least on my computer)
    
    Deleting the divisor fixes the issue.

    order to check for proper clickpad press transition, we need to check if
    any of the left, middle, and right logical button states are pressed.

    Fix clickfinger actions when middle button emulation is enabled
    
    When MBE is enabled, a physical left button press is delayed until a
    timeout is reached. This results in the logical left button being
    depressed while the physical left button is pressed. The physical state
    is stored as the "old" hw state, and it is used for detecting a
    transition from depressed to pressed for clickfinger actions. Since the
    "old" hw state shows the left button pressed, but the current logical
    state shows the left button unpressed, when the MBE timeout fires and we
    set the logical left button pressed the transition check fails.
    
    Since the "old" hw state is only used for clickfinger left button press
    transitions, redefining it to hold the previous logical hw state is
    sufficient for fixing the bug and should not cause any regressions.

    Ignore motion during touch count changes on semi-mt devices
    
    Semi-mt devices do not track touches. The locations of touches are
    unknown, we only have the bounding box of two of them. When the number of
    fingers changes, the bounding box coordinates may change as well, but
    the cumulative relative motion updates at that instant are invalid.
    
    To work around this, ignore changes in cumulative relative motion if the
    touch count changes.

    Calculate touch data for semi-mt devices, but don't send touch events
    
    Previously, all touch data from semi-mt devices was ignored because the
    X server doesn't support them. However, the touch data must be used for
    proper clickpad handling.
    
    Instead of ignoring semi-mt device touch events, mark the device as
    being semi-mt and allow initialization of the touch state. The touches
    will then be used in calculating the cumulative_d{x,y} values that are
    needed for clickpad support.
    
    When handling the touch data for X event processing, simply skip over
    reporting the touches.

    Disable scrolling when beginning a clickpad press
    
    There really isn't a point to scrolling while a clickpad is pressed. In
    particular, the clickpad button areas and the horizontal edge scrolling
    areas overlap, so horizontal edge scrolling must be disabled. Also,
    performing two finger scrolling while a third finger presses the button
    would require us to inhibit touch events until four touches are present.
    That is enough reason to disable two finger scrolling as well.

    While the clickpad button is not pressed, cumulative_d{x,y} will match x
    and y values. Once the clickpad button is pressed, cumulative_d{x,y}
    will be updated with the relative motion of each active touch on the
    touchpad. This allows for dragging with one finger while another finger
    stays stationary holding the clickpad button down.
    
    This is an easier and less latent approach than trying to guess which
    touch was the "dragging" touch.

    Don't use linear regression when calculating touchpad motion deltas
    
    The results depend on the data rate of the device. A device with a
    higher data rate, and thus lower individual deltas, will behave
    differently with the regression calculation.
    
    This can be verified on Synaptics semi-mt clickpads. The data rate is
    halved when two or more touches are on the device. When trying to press
    a button and drag the cursor with another touch, the motion will feel
    faster than dragging with only one touch on the device.

    If the device is turned off, usually by syndaemon to disable the
    touchpad while the typing, the touch state will not be updated with the
    latest hardware state changes. If a touch begins while the device is
    off and ends while the device is on, then the touch count will be
    decremented without any previous increment. A similar effect will occur
    if the device is on when the touch begins, but off when the touch ends.
    
    If the touch count goes negative, the index into the touch slot mask
    array will be out of bounds. This can corrupt memory and cause random
    crashes.

    Revert "Don't store fake events in the motion history"
    
    This commit introduced a regression. On some touchpads, the pointer keeps
    moving in the last direction when the finger movement stops but the finger
    is left on the touchpad.
    
    Cause appears to be get_delta() which calculates the deltas based on the
    motion history but has no control flow for the lack of fake motion events
    in the history after this commit. Thus, under some conditions, the delta is
    always non-zero as the history does not change.

    Prefer multitouch over single-touch axis ranges
    
    We still use single-touch data in most cases, but sometimes the
    multitouch axes have higher resolution. Since we use the same XI
    valuators to report ST and MT data, we must pick one axis and scale the
    other to match. This change picks the MT axis ranges.

    Allocate SynapticsHwStruct for local function use
    
    SynapticsHwStruct (SHS) will soon include ValuatorMasks, which can only
    be allocated on the heap. The input driver callbacks are called in
    signal context, so we can't instantiate a new SHS when that occurs.
    Since we only ever need one SHS, allocate one at device init time and
    use it in place of local SHS instances.

    The algorithm is completely wrong because it uses subtraction of

    cursor warps to edges or corners of the screen.
    
    Since the algorithm has never worked right, previous testing must be

    Submit the right number of MT axes
    
    For devices with only x/y, num_mt_axes is 0, since x/y are already counted

    touch axes if we have any touch axes at all.

    This commit reverts 13543b156d78bc4d01a19844a5ee8f283269621b
    
    As seen in Debian's #648488, this switch causes a regression on
    PowerPC, especially seen on iBook G4 with appletouch. Take a defensive
    stance and revert back to a working state until things have been figured
    out and fixed properly.
    
    Since things have evolved and since that revert triggers a lot of
    conflicts, the following method was applied:
     - manual reintroduction of the 3 removed macros: OFF, LONG, TEST_BIT
     - coccinelle semantic patch to revert from BitIsOn to TEST_BIT
    
    Coccinelle semantic patch:
      @@
      expression a,b;

    Use the scroll distances as increment for scrolling valuator axes
    
    XI2.1 allows an 'increment' for each scrolling variable. Use that instead of
    hiding it away inside the driver.

    Only drivers depend xserver
    
    2) XORG_CFLAGS may contain, depending on the platform, a compiler
    visibilty flag. Compiler flags cannot be assigned to AM_CPPFLAGS
    preprocessor flags variable.
    
    There were two changes introduced by the patch.
    1) Possible wrong order of include directives
    The commit text does not mention which paths may be in the wrong order.
    
    2) Incorrect usage of AM_LDFLAGS
    The patch does not really change anything. If the intention was for the tools
    to link directly to the libraries, it would look like:
    
      LDADD =  $(top_builddir)/src/libpciaccess.la # scanpci example
    
    This is only possible for libraries built in the same package.
    There is nothing wrong in putting -l -L flags in LDADD, but should there
    be other flags, LDFLAGS would be required, ending with two variables.
    
    It looks easier to revert the patch to the previosuly known good version
    which has been in service for a year.
    
    Unfortunatly, the reversal breaks distcheck as it removes an unsuspected workaround.
    The value of sdkdir during distcheck points to an empty xserver sdkdir
    where xserver-properties.h is expected by the tools.
    
    Specifying XORG_CFLAGS worked around the issue by supplying the real path
    to the xserver sdk.

    Revert "build: collapse all Makefile.am files into a single non-recursive one."
    
    This reverts commit 39afe69ad7d2258d4043044d1283bd6e311e48da.
    
    1. For such a small module, the build time improvement is most likely
    negligible. At least, I'd like to see some timings proving it's
    worthiness before seeing the patch go back in.
    
    2. This kind of change would need a thorough review. The need to
    operate the build from a single toplevel Makefile is a significant
    change. The two most noticeable issues for me are that collapsing all
    the Makefiles could easily cause namespacing issues with the
    variables, and operating on files outside the current directory can
    introduce subtle bugs. I feel that the non-recursive style is
    generally less robust than the standard recursive make scheme.
    
    3. It's unlike all the other X.org modules. This isn't a showstopper
    for me, but the recursive style is well understood here and you've
    beaten all the modules into a consistent format that makes build bugs
    unique to specific modules less likely.

    To give a concrete example for #3 above, the 175 man pages are much
    easier maintained using a very similar makefile in the man directory
    of all X.Org module.
    
    The cost of maintaining a single makefile is much higher. Every target
    in the makefile has to be reviewed and tested when changes are made.
    Not everyone has the all the skills to handle widely different targets
    such as man pages, DocBook/XML, librairies, C code, distribution hooks,
    and so on.

    This reverts commit d27b4e560ccf61b94f067156c6d5c1e3d3e5e1eb.
    
    ChangeLog is generated from git and should be created at dist time only.
    The original patch creates it at make time multiple times and fails
    when user permissions change such as when using sudo.
    
    Some have expressed a desire to install files such as ChangeLog and README.
    This reversal does not dismiss the idea, but simply reverts a non-essential
    change that happens to have an implementation bug just before making a module
    release.
    
    Anyone is welcome to promote the idea in the context of the X.Org project
    where all modules would exhibit the same behaviour. The current behaviour of
    ChangeLog, although not perfect, has been thoroughly reviewed and widely
    accepted for several years.
    
    As for the files in docs, they should be re-submitted for reviews to determine
    if they constitute users docs that should be installed as opposed to
    developers docs which are not.

    Revert "build: apply the distcheck tricks used in xf86-input-evdev"
    
    This reverts commit 6eb829e07e455a8a04dabae7f257dd42a9b8bcdf.
    
    Althought this feature is desirable, it introduces a dormant bug.
    
    The value of sdkdir during distcheck points to an empty xserver sdkdir
    where xserver-properties.h is expected by the tools.
    
    Specifying XORG_CFLAGS for the tools worked around the issue by supplying
    the real path to the xserver sdk. tools must not depend on xserver.
    In any case it would be a brittle workaround.
    
    --with-xorg-conf-dir='$${sysconfdir}/xorg':
    althought this value will work, it brings some confusion as it is
    unrelated to the where the configuration files are normally placed,
    relative to $prefix which is /usr/share/X11 and not /etc.
    
    This feature can be reintroduced later with the proper solution.

    Don't autoprobe for devices when Option Device is set.
    
    If only Option Device is set but no protocol, the code calls into
    AutoDevProbe. eventcomm (the only backend with an AutoDevProbe) then runs
    through all /dev/input/event devices and takes the first one it can find.
    
    If two touchpads are connected on a system, this may cause the same touchpad
    to be added twice and the other one not at all - even though the device path
    is specified. (This can only happen when the event device is not grabbed,
    otherwise the grabcheck prevents the touchpad from being added twice)
    
    Pass the device option into AutoDevProbe and check that device first. If it
    is a touchpad, finish with success. If it isn't, fail AutoDevProbe.

    eventcomm: move need_grab into a proto-specific struct.
    
    Don't just assign a BOOL to proto_data, use a struct for readability.
    This changes nothing in the code, especially since need_grab is always
    false.
    
    The current code assumes that if a proto_data field is present, we respect
    the need_grab from this field. Otherwise, we always try to grab.
    need_grab is however always FALSE, so all this is mostly for readability, if
    not necessarily understandability...

    Add hysteresis-based noise reduction
    
    This introduces hysteresis into the driver's processing. It significantly
    reduces noise motion, i.e. now the pad does no longer generate a stream of
    sub-pixel events when just holding the position with the finger down.
    Also, taking off the finger no longer generates additional motion,
    scrolling becomes flicker-free etc.
    
    The code makes use of "fuzz" from the kernel, if available. This has not
    been tested extensively, as an overwhelming majority of evdev touchpad
    drivers view 0 (zero) as a good value for fuzz, forcing userland into
    assuming "zero fuzz" means "make zero assumptions about fuzz", not
    "there is no fuzz". Until things improve, this is what we do.
    
    Anyway, the fuzz a.k.a. hysteresis can be set/overridden with options
    and properties, as documented.

    Don't expect a palm based on pressure (#22806)
    
    If the first touch on the touchpad is above palm_min_z, the palm detection
    unsets the finger status ("probably palm"). Don't do that, for low values of
    palm_min_z this disables the finger during normal use of the touchpad.

    synaptics: detect corner tap using the initial touch position
    
    Currently, when detecting a tap release, the corner tap detection
    uses the current touch position to figure out which corner it
    corresponds. The problem is that, theoretically, there is no such position
    because there is no touch. It work in mosts cases because most touchpad
    are fast enough to still have a position on release, but some aren't.
    
    In that case, the driver do corner tap detection using the position
    given by the hardware when there is no touch, that is, (0,0), (1,5855)
    or whatever. The driver will detect them as corner tap, regardless of
    the initial touch position. On the default configuration, corner taps
    are ignored, so basically, these tap are not working.
    
    This patch make tap detection use the initial touch position to
    detect corner taps.

    syndaemon: decouple background mode from quietness
    
    syndaemon currently outputs lots of stuff when not running in background mode.
    However, current init daemons and session managers can manage to launch the
    daemon in background without "-b" just fine (if not better), by doing the
    fork() themselves. Indeed, if one uses that setup, ie. by having syndaemon
    launched by GNOME at login, it gets the ~/.xsession-errors file spammed by
    Enable/Disabled messages.
    
    This patch fixes this by introducing a new verbose (-v) flag that enables those
    messages and makes syndaemon quiet by default.

    config: don't autoprobe when device was set
    
    If device was already set, we were asked to handle that specific device
    and we should not go probing around. If we do, we might end up handling
    a device different from what the X server thinks we are handling, with
    dire consequences in case of hot plugging and unplugging.
    
    Without this patch, a situation such as the following can happen.
    
    A user has both a built-in laptop touchpad and a tablet such as the
    Wacom Bamboo Pen & Touch, that is also exposed as a touchpad.
    
    The tablet is plugged in before the server starts, and during setup the
    server calls the synaptic driver for the /dev/input/mouseX device
    corresponding to the touch device of the tablet; we end up in the
    autoprobe path even though `device' was set, and the driver scans
    /dev/input, where the first useful device it finds is the event device
    for the built-in touchpad.
    
    The driver starts managing the built-in touchpad, preventing future
    instances from managing it too, while the server thinks the driver is
    managing the tablet.
    
    When the user disconnects the tablet, the corresponding instance of the
    synpatics driver (which is actually managing the touchpad instead) is
    unloaded: the built-in touchpad stops working in X.

    Reset X/Y hist on multi finger transition to fix jumps
    
    Most modern touchpads track 1st finger during multi-touch.  If first finger
    is lifted then a jump will occur as X/Y transition to next finger location.
    Resetting X/Y history as each finger is lifted will hide this transition.
    
    Synaptics hw specs claim older hardware report X/Y values that are average
    point between multi-fingers which can cause unwanted jump.  Reset X/Y
    history during transition to new fingers to hide this as well.

    Align EmulateTwoFinger* docs to current behavior.
    
    This corrects man page to mention EmulateTwoFingerMinW
    and EmulateTwoFingerMinZ are considered together.  Old
    man page read like driver would emulate two-finger even
    if only pressure OR width (but not both) were supported.
    
    Next, add note to align man page with patch that defaults
    to enabling two-finger emulation on hardware that does not
    support two-finger detection but does support pressure and
    width detection.

    Default to 2-finger emulation when HW supports it
    
    Ideally, emulating 2-fingers should just work on hardware
    were it can be supported. This patch is to do that.
    
    Currently, emulateTwoFingerMinW defaults to 7. Most kernel
    drivers do not support reporting finger width and so can't get above
    MinW of 7. Synaptics devices hardcode width value to 5 when
    hardware doesn't support width and 7 is a good threshold to detect
    2 fingers on hardware that does. bcm7954 are only other devices
    that report width and they support reporting DOUBLETAP and wouldn't
    need emulation anyways.
    
    emulateTwoFingerMinZ defaulted to a really high value so never
    let Synaptics devices to emulate 2-fingers by default.
    Changed default to a low value (same as FingerHigh) when hardware
    doesn't support DOUBLETAP and supports width so emulations
    will now work by default in all the right cases.
    
    I'm working to get kernel to stop reporting ABS_TOOL_WIDTH unless
    hardware really supports it.  If that would have been behavior
    in first place then we could also default to 2-finger scrolling as
    well.  Since its not reliable, we should continue defaulting to
    side scrolling.
    
    Config GUI's will want to now allow switching between 2-finger and edge
    scrolling when new property indicates width is supported.  GUI's should
    also update the above MinZ and MinW's to values similar to our defaults.

    Make default checks for x, y, w, and p separate.
    
    Some input devices will not return any ranges and
    current code seems geared towards those.  It assumed
    if invalid X/Y ranges then that was only case for invalid
    W and Pressure.
    
    Synaptics kernel drivers have been returning valid
    X/Y/Z values but invalid 0/0 values for P.
    
    Split up checks to allow setting defaults for any combination
    of unspecified or invalid values.
    
    I also think there was a bug in older code.  It seemed odd
    it was checking minx > maxx but miny < maxy.  I changed both
    to ">=" so that it also catches kernel reports of 0/0 and
    logically invalid ranges (i.e. 6/6 or 9/1).

    config: close a loophole where user input means x server has a feature
    
    If a user provides a path in --with-xorg-conf-dir,
    the configuartion assumes the server does have a config path which may
    not be the case.
    
    Resolve this by testing the value of the server returned sysconfigdir
    rather than the user provided value.

    This patch makes input in the dead area essentially disappear to the client.
    If a finger is detected outside the active area, it's coordinates and other
    data is reset to zero. Edge detection and scrolling is skipped and the event
    is not recorded in the movement history.
    
    On touchpads that require this area, it is now possible to click the button
    while leaving another finger on the touchpad.

    Disable ClickFinger for touchpads with more than one physical button (#26079)
    
    If a touchpad has more than just one (or no) button, don't enable any
    ClickFinger settings other than button 1.
    
    The old default of enabling those clickfingers can be confusing on devices
    that have left and right buttons but no middle. In that case, leaving three
    fingers on the touchpad and clicking will result in a button 2 press
    (usually paste). But leaving one or two fingers on the touchpad while
    clicking will simply send button 1 events.
    
    This can appear like spurious button 2 events to the user.

    Don't destroy the timer on DeviceOff.
    
    DeviceOff is VT switch, DeviceClose is unplug.  We need the timer
    pre-allocated since we set it during the signal handler and so can't
    allocate it then, so merely cancel it at DeviceOff, and delete it in
    DeviceClose.

    Remove the "SpecialScrollAreaRight" option.  (#21001)
    
    This option auto-adjusts the right edge on the touchpad but wrongly so. It
    does not take the edge width into account, thus setting the right edge to
    the max value received - leaving only a single-pixel scroll area in some
    cases.
    
    A previous attempt to auto-adjust edges has failed (afb60a0b). The kernel's
    min/max values cannot be relied on for actual range clipping and thus scroll
    edge settings are best left untouched.

    Revert "Auto-adjust edges if values fall outside queried min/max ranges. (#21001)"
    
    This reverts commit afb60a0b2497c5d08cbd1739fa8ae6585c428881.
    
    From comment 24 to #21001:
    I've been running this code for over a week now and I'm not happy with it.
    Once I move over to the right, the scroll-edge becomes so small that it's
    hard to trigger.
    
    Source of the problem is the information provided by the kernel. The kernel
    hands us a min/max value for the synaptics pads but this value is not
    reflective of the actual physical boundaries. The other dimensions are based
    on these min/max ranges.
    
    My RightEdge setting by default is 5129, after moving to the right it
    becomes 5677. The announced max for x is 5472.  We have model-specific edge
    settings and in the case of synaptics the width of the scroll area is 7% of
    the total width (based on min/max). This works, but obviously only because
    the max is wrong. I've tried upping this to 15% and it works fine but unless
    the edge is adjusted the scroll bar takes over too much of the pad.
    
    So right now I'm inclined to revert this patch and just ditch any
    auto-adjustment of scroll edges whatsoever. This way, the original setting
    is maintained even if we reach outside of the min/max area.

    Add active area outside of which movements, scrolling, tapping are ignored.
    
    On some touchpads physical buttons are located under the touchpad surface. As a
    result, when users try to perform a click, by pressing that part of the surface
    of the touchpad, they get a click, a movement, a tap and (in some cases) a scroll,
    which can make clicks quite inaccurate.
    
    The "Synaptics Area" property can be used to define the edges of the active area of
    the touchpad so that all movement, scrolling and tapping which take place outside
    of this area will be ignored. This property is disabled by default.

    Add configurable x/y resolution to fix sensitivity on wide touchpads.
    
    Synaptics uses anisotropic coordinate system.  On some wide touchpads
    vertical resolution can be twice as high as horizontal which causes
    unequal sensitivity on x/y directions.
    
    VertResolution and HorizResolution can be used to set the resolution.
    The ratio of the values is used to compensate x/y sensitivity.  The
    properties are configured automatically if touchpad reports resolution
    and if running on linux 2.6.31 or newer.

    Auto-adjust edges if values fall outside queried min/max ranges. (#21001)
    
    The kernel provides min/max for x/y values but still allows devices to send
    coordinates outside this range. If the edges are autodetected, re-adjust the
    edge settings to fit within the new effective min/max range.
    
    When the edges change the property needs to be updated accordingly. This
    can't be done immediately as changing properties requires mallocs and
    HandleState is called during the signal handler.
    Instead, set a timer to be called when the server isn't busy and update the
    property then. The delay between setting the timer and sending the property
    notify event also reduces the number of events sent, the property event
    includes the latest state only.
    
    If the edges were configured by the user, don't re-adjust.
    This obsoletes the SpecialScrollAreaRight option as it provides the same
    functionality, without the side-effects triggering 21001.

    eventcomm: fix return value of event_query_is_touchpad.
    
    "ret" is used both for storing the ioctls return value as well as for the
    return of event_query_is_touchpad. If an ioctl fails, ret is -1 and we
    return this value as a BOOL. The caller treats this -1 as TRUE and thinks
    the device is a touchpad.

    synclient: up max value for AccelFactor to 1.0
    
    There's no real reason to restrict AccelFactor to 0.2, the driver itself
    doesn't restrict AccelFactor either. Upwards of 1.0 it's hard to spot any
    real differences in speed though, so 1.0 seems like a sensible maximum.

    eventcomm: force boolean values for has_left, has_right, etc.
    
    TEST_BIT simply returns the value of the bytes, so we end up with has_left
    and friends being an integer value instead of a boolean value. This again
    may cause confusion in other parts, if a 1/0 boolean value is expected (e.g.
    all xf86SetBoolOption()).

    Add TapAndDragGesture option and gestures property.
    
    The tap-and-drag gesture is an alternative way of dragging.
    It is performed by tapping (touching and releasing the finger), then
    touching again and moving the finger on the touchpad.
    This gesture is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting the
    TapAndDragGesture option to false.
    
    The gesture already existed in synaptics and was always enabled. This
    commit adds an option to switch it on/off. The default behavior is
    tap-and-drag being enabled, that is, TapAndDragGesture is true.
    
    The "Synaptics Gestures" property is intended to hold all new gesture
    enabling options, like options for the upcoming multitouch gestures.

    eventcomm: if we can't grab the device, assume it's not a touchpad.
    
    If a device is configured in the xorg.conf, it will get added once in the
    config, once through HAL. Since we grab the device, the second device will be
    mute. And confuses tools and users alike.
    
    So let's just assume that if we can't grab the device, it doesn't exist.

    Add model-specific edges for appletouch.
    
    Needs around 8.5% to be useable.
    
    I created a table to iterate through the different products rather than
    using if/else branches.  I can enumerate the appletouch product_ids, but I
    suspect they will all be around the same range (hence the PRODUCT_ANY).  If
    another product id shows different behavior, we can just add an entry to
    the table as appropriate.
    
    I also changed the default eheight to be 5.4% to match the spec.

    Add TouchpadModel specifier and scale the edges accordingly. (#21214)
    
    ALPS models need different edge settings than synaptics pads to make the edges
    work propertly. So try to auto-detect the model (eventcomm anyway) and set the
    edges accordingly.
    
    New edge defaults are:
     synaptics: 7% of the total width
     alps: 15% of the total width
     unknown: 4% of the total width (see Synaptics UI guide)

    PS/2 interface: sense multifinger taps on FingerHigh (#21427)
    
    Previously multifinger taps were sensed on the Z value > 0: this isn't
    very correct.  Accorging to the specification, Z values below 30
    correspond only to a very light taps or just floating fingers.  I had
    run into the situation when I was clicking on the physical left button
    and that click was transformed to the right button click via
    ClickFinger2, but I wasn't tapping the touchpad at all.  Investigations
    showed very small values of Z -- my other fingers were just floating
    above touchpad.
    
    This change also makes click (and finger) detection more consistent,
    because it uses FingerHigh to detect taps everywhere.

    Ignore moves during tap processing if no finger is down.
    
    The Dell Inspiron 1520 with a Synaptics touchpad loves to send event like
    these after every finger release :
    
        time     x    y   z f  w  l r u d m     multi  gl gm gr gdx gdy
       1.563  3224 1625  57 1  5  0 0 0 0 0  00000000   0  0  0   0   0

    Most of the time these events are ignored by the driver, but sometimes it
    confuses two-finger scrolling and tap detection.
    
    For example, in this log, the first tap is recognized, the second isn't :

    The problem with the second tap is that the driver check if the movement from
    (3848,2361) to (1,5855) is over TapMaxMove before it checks for a finger release.
    So the driver considers it as a (short) finger move.
    Add the condition ''the finger is still present'' to the 'move' condition, so
    we ignore these moves..

    Add support for touchpads (such as Elantech) that do not report pressure
    
    Change the driver to react to BTN_TOUCH if device does not report
    ABS_PRESSURE since there are touchpads (such as Elantech) that do not
    support pressure reading but otherwise are perfectly useable in absolute
    mode.
    
    Also fix error checking of ioctl calls (positive return value is not an
    error, only negative is).

    [syndaemon] use Xrecord extension in syndaemon to avoid polling.
    
    This patch prevents the polling of the keyboard state. Instead it uses the
    XRecord extension of the Xserver for an event triggered notification of key
    events. Of course, there is a fallback to the polling when no XRecord
    extension is found. This should finally stop complains of syndaemon
    preventing good power saving.

    Provide default button emulation also for touchscreens
    
    The new auto-detection functionality of the driver provides a default
    way to produce left, right and middle clicks for all trackpads and
    touchscreens, based on capabilty. However, the current code only
    provides single click for touchscreens and trackpads without buttons.
    This patch turns on multi-finger tapping for such devices.

    Remove repeater functionality.
    
    Remove the repeater functionality completely from the synaptics touchpad
    driver. It is buggy in its current implementation and its usefulness is
    questionable.
    
    According to the INSTALL file, the repeater is there only for testing. In
    fact, if a supported device is found even a configured repeater fifo is
    automatically disabled. For most users the functionality is therefore
    irrelevant and can be confusing. If I understand the workings of the
    repeater correctly, a developer could instead just read the data directly
    from an unsupported device's character special file under /dev
    or /dev/input.
    
    With today's more dynamic device configuration possibilities via udev and
    hal it's also less likely that the synaptics driver would silently block
    another devices data, this situation being for what the repeater
    functionality seems to have been introduced in the past.

    Corrections based on dimension analysis
    
    The biggest change is to the speed and acceleration parameters, which should
    now scale properly.  Starting from one end and moving a finger really slowly
    across the touchpad, the pointer should move about 40 percent of the way from
    one end to the other. Repeating the process more quickly, the pointer should
    move about 70 percent. Finally, moving really quickly, the pointer should
    reach the the other end of the screen before the whole touchpad has been
    crossed.

    ReadDevDimensions on opened device
    
    The auto-dev probing requires opening the device locally to determine the type of device, so

    Pre-probe the device (eventcomm only).
    
    For auto-dev, we'd probe the device node and get the axis ranges. If we
    specify the device however we didn't retrieve the axis ranges and thus got
    stuck with the defaults - losing out on automatic edge and accel calculation.
    
    This is an issue if the device is hotplugged, as HAL will specify the device
    node.
    
    This patch adds another hook to synproto_operations to pre-probe the device.
    This hook is only used by eventcomm and opens the FD, queries the axis range
    and closes the FD again.

    Don't lose button up event if timeout is cancelled in the same ReadInput cycle
    
    On a left/right button press, middle button emulation springs into action and
    changes the reported hw state. It then returns a delay that is supposed to set
    a timer. No button event is posted to the server, the timer ensures that it'll
    be posted later.
    
    If however - in the same cycle - the button up is reported, but with a
    hardware time > middle emulation timeout, the middle button emulation is
    canceled. The hw state is reset to button down, and processing continues,
    reporting the button down event.
    Since this is in the same cycle, the new delay overrides the previous one and
    the timer is never set.
    
    Introduce a new state into MB emulation that forces the click event if the
    above situation occurs.

    When two-finger-scrolling quickly and distinctly, the two-finger tapping gets activated, effectively selecting a portion of the selected text. The synaptics code already has logic to prevent taps from

    Fix the "No such device" problem when reloading a driver
    
    The xf86SetStrOption function only sets the option variable to the local default if not already
    set to something else. Thus, the code which reloads a particular device by using this function
    often fails, simply because the sought device name isnt set properly.

    The attached patch fixes two off-by-one errors in the Synaptics driver's

    completely set tap or click actions, as any attempt to set the correct
    number of items fails.

    Note: This file is not installed by default. Distributions are free to install
    it or leave it.

     * clicking with two fingers = right click
     * clicking with 3 fingers = middle mouse button

    This is the second part of fixing the backend part of synaptics. The new build

    only build the backends that are available on these platforms. Also it will
    remove any reference from the built driver to the non-available backends.

    Initial version that passes "make distcheck".
    
    This version is able to build against latest xorg git (including xinput
    changes for MPX). It incoperates many concepts stolen from xf86-input-evdev.
    I'm not sure about *BSD support, but from what I understood psmcomm is only
    used on *BSD whild eventcomm is only used on Linux. So I enabled the build
    of these only on the given operating system. Also fix some minor issues that
    are related to the old build system (VERSION_ID related).

    Add the autogen.sh from xf86-input-evdev.
    
    We will use a similar buildsystem now.

    Drop the spec file for rpm packagers.
    
    I doubt the file was still used and I don't think it belongs upstream anyway.
    Next to that I think my changes will break this stuff.

    Move the current documents to the docs folder.
    
    We should merge the interesting content to the manpages.

    Drop now useless files.
    
    The file "FILES" stated which files contained which content, but the list was
    outdated and I dropped many of the files anyway
    The "usbhid" stuff could be done better using udev rules and from what I know
    (and my knowledge is rather limited) no distribution still uses the hotplug
    daemon.
    The "usbmouse" script was a simple wrapper for calling the synclient.

    Drop a patch for the Linux 2.4.3 kernel.
    
    This is a really old patch and no longer relevant.

    Start moving out the docs to an appropriate directory.
    
    We will provide the current documents in the docs directory. The interesting
    stuff should be merged into the manpages though.

    Rename the "manpages" directory to "man".
    
    This way it is similar to the structure of the xf86-input-evdev driver.

    Drop the alps support patch for the linux kernel.
    
    This patch was merged upstream, no need to provide it.

    Drop old include files from the monolithic XFree86 server.
    
    The new build system will use pkg-config to figure out the necessary includes
    so we don't need to ship these.

    Start reorganizing the source tree
    
    First let's move the source and header files to a seperate source directory.
    The structure of the new directory layout will be similar to xf86-input-evdev.

Author: Florian Loitsch <synaptics@florian.loitsch.com>
Date:   Thu May 17 13:10:30 2007 +0200

    Add a timeout to locked drags.
    
    Instead of locking indefinitely, dragging is realeased after a
    timeout. By default I've set it to 5 seconds to minimize changes to
    previous configurations. For me a value of 450ms works best.
    New Parameter: LockedDragTimeout

    Allow to easily switch between move and scroll.
    
    To observe the behavior: move with 1 finger. During movement add a 2nd
    finger. If the touchpad supports it then the driver switches
    seamlessly to scroll mode. Worked on the Macbook touchpad, but failed
    on some Dell touchpad.

Date:   Thu May 17 10:12:05 2007 +0200

    On Linux 2.6, the evdev interface provides support for requesting the
    resolution of input devices. The included patch uses this to set the
    defaults for various parameters. As a result, synaptics, alps and
    appletouch pads all work approximately identically without requiring
    model-specific configuration. The defaults should be almost identical to
    the current defaults on synaptics pads. We've shipped this code in the
    current Ubuntu release (7.04) without any known user issues. This is
    against current git.

    Implement 2-finger emulation for ALPS touchpads.
    
    A new parameter, EmulateTwoFingerMinZ, makes the driver emulate
    2-finger scrolling (and tapping) when the finger pressure is big
    enough. This is no real multi-finger detection (the ALPS hardware
    can't do that), but seems to work quite well in practice.

    Don't include $(DESTDIR) in $(INSTALLED_X).
    
    Mattia Dongili writes:
    
    In your new release I found a little bug in the Makefile in one use of
    $(DESTDIR), when assigning the $(INSTALLED_X) variable.
    
    Since its usage is mainly to find _real_ includes, while DESTDIR is

    Add new parameter "SingleTapTimeout".
    
    This patch adds a new parameter - "SingleTapTimeout" - to control the
    "2A -> SINGLETAP" transition.
    
    This gives greater control of tap behavior. For exmple, it is possible
    to disable tap-and-drag by setting the parameter to 0.

    key presses. This way the touchpad is not disabled if you press alt-f1,
    but release the alt key before the f1 key.

    Vertical/horizontal scrolling was incorrectly stopped then
    the finger left the lower right corner if the scrolling was started
    from within that corner. The problem was that in that case both
    horizontal and vertical scrolling was enabled at the same time until
    the finger left the corner. When the finger left the corner, one of the
    scrolling directions was supposed to stop, but buggy handling of
    coasting made both scrolling directions stop.

    Make the device name change code handle more cases. Patch
    from Karl Tomlinson <k.tomlinson@auckland.ac.nz>, who writes:
    
    There are two issues that are resolved here:
    
    1 The call to xf86ReplaceStrOption in DeviceOn, when the device
      file can no longer be opened seems unnecessary and causes
      problems.  If Protocol is auto-dev then Device is reset anyway
      (through SetDeviceAndProtocol).  If Protocol is something else
      then the device file will never be found even after it is
      recreated because Device is never set again.
    
    2 The first xf86OpenSerial in DeviceOn may successfully open a
      different mouse (or other event file) that has the same name as
      the Device found through the first invocation of auto-dev.  It
      seems reasonable that if auto-dev is used to find the device
      file the first time, then it can be used to find it again after
      the device has been closed (and possibly changed name).

commit 8f0a0663b5ef22bc5ed34e7bddbc2856311c5133
Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
Date:   Sun Jul 10 00:07:53 2005 +0200

    The touchpad stopped working if you did:
    1. From inside X ran "rmmod psmouse"
    2. Switched to the console
    3. Switched back to X
    4. Ran "modprobe psmouse"
    5. Switched to the console.
    6. Switched back to X.
    After this sequence, the device name was set to an event device but the
    protocol was psaux. The problem was that when the auto-redetection
    failed in step 3, the protocol was set to psaux but the device name was
    not cleared. In step 6, opening the old event device succeeded again,
    so SetDeviceAndProtocol() was not called, and the protocol remained set
    to psaux.

    /dev/input/event nodes are missing, which can happen when using a udev
    based system.

commit 8bf71c9a02a6400113ee9b7924272d4b3b1e27d4
Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 10 23:56:06 2005 +0100

    Fixed alpscomm.c so that the X server doesn't lock up if you
    incorrectly configure the driver to read from an event device using
    protocol "alps". Trying to read less than the size of the input_event
    structure size will fail, which triggered an infinite select + read
    loop.

    When coasting starts, take the partial scroll step from the
    manual scrolling into account. This eliminates a small delay before the
    first generated coasting scroll event.

Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
Date:   Thu Jan 6 02:25:20 2005 +0100

    Implemented coasting, ie the ability to automatically
    continue scrolling with the same speed in the same direction when the
    finger leaves the touchpad.

    Fixed off-by-one error (see also change
    7c06552920a09c89f986102ec60869d3dbcb0274) in edge motion
    speed calculations that made the speed approximately twice as big as
    intended. Updated suggested parameter settings accordingly.

Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 5 21:12:39 2005 +0100

    Fixed a bug that made it possible to lock up the X server by
    setting VertScrollDelta, HorizScrollDelta or CircScrollDelta to 0 while
    the touchpad was scrolling.

    Always update the move_hist[] buffer when a finger is on the
    touchpad. Will be needed to implement coasting.

Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 5 17:48:38 2005 +0100

    Fixed off-by-one error in the pointer motion dx/dy
    calculations. This fix will slow down the pointer movements, so to
    regain the same speed as before, the MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor
    parameters should be multiplied by 1.5.

commit fa1793bd9e03db888089319c269557d671ac2fce
Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 5 15:27:25 2005 +0100

    Rearranged code in HandleScrolling() to make it slightly
    more logical.

Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 5 15:18:39 2005 +0100

    Made it possible to use horizontal circular scrolling by
    smoothly switching from "horizontal" to "horizontal circular" when the
    finger enters the lower left or lower right corners during horizontal
    scrolling. See also change eeb40cac2b2dfa411618f2ecbffedc85166e675f.

commit fdef1418e342dace2eccb79486188d15129b8832
Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
Date:   Wed Jan 5 12:48:22 2005 +0100

    Better noise reduction in the x/y delta estimates used for
    pointer motion. The derivative estimate is now based on linear
    regression from the last four x/y values instead of the last three.
    This means that white noise is amplified by a factor of sqrt(.2)
    instead of sqrt(.5), ie the factor of improvement is 1.58. Similar
    improvements have been observed in data from a real synaptics
    touchpad.
    Also, the computations are performed in floating point math to avoid
    round off errors for very slow finger movements.

commit aa8910ec72f4d5b805c59c609f48c55cc3f8adf8
Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
Date:   Tue Jan 4 00:41:24 2005 +0100

    Improved edge motion behavior. The speed no longer depends
    on the MinSpeed, MaxSpeed and AccelFactor parameters, and it doesn't
    depend on the packet rate from the touchpad hardware.
    The EdgeMotionMinSpeed and EdgeMotionMaxSpeed parameters may have to be
    modified to get the same speed as before this change.

    Better fix for the crash fixed in change
    cbee47a1f26038ade7386fa52b41d1828036dd1e. The shared
    memory area is now removed at DEVICE_CLOSE time but recreated if
    necessary at DEVICE_INIT time. This fixes the problem where the shared
    memory area was not deleted when exiting the X server, thereby fooling
    the synclient program to think the driver was still active.

Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
Date:   Sun Jan 2 21:34:40 2005 +0100

    Made it possible to disable tapping without disabling mouse
    movements. Added -t switch to syndaemon to disable only tapping in
    response to keyboard activity.

    Made the event device auto detection more robust. Check for
    required features (ABS_X, ABS_Y, ABS_PRESSURE and BTN_TOOL_FINGER)
    instead of relying on the IDs of the input device.
    Suggested by Vojtech Pavlik.

    Fixed some problems with ALPS guest devices.
    From Alastair M. Robinson:
    
    * The guest mouse doesn't report button releases.
    
    * The stick pointer has buttons of its own, and they don't work.
    
      Attached is another patch, this one far less invasive than the last,
      which fixes these two problems.
      (The button presses that come from the stick pointer's buttons arrive
      in events with pressure set to 127, just like stick movement - but
      this doesn't seem to be terribly reliable - I think the button
      release gets reported with true pressure when the touchpad is being
      used too.  For this reason, I've set these up to report as ->left /
      ->right, not as ->guest_left / ->guest_right.)
    
    * One issue that remains - the middle button emulation for two button
      mice doesn't seem to work for the guest mouse.
      Fixed by me.

    Patch from Alastair M. Robinson
    <blackfive@fakenhamweb.co.uk> to make the ALPS dual trackpad found on
    Dell CPx machines work. (For 2.4 kernels.)
    
    In order to get my trackpad working in absolute mode I had to make some
    modifications to the driver:
    
    Firstly, initialising the trackpad on this model is more complicated
    than other ALPS devices; the usual "magic knock" must be performed for
    both the trackpad and the pointing device, and I found that I needed a
    device reset first to get reliable initialisation.
    
    Secondly, the pointing stick, for obvious reasons, provides relative
    data even when the trackpad is in absolute mode.
    
    Thirdly, the guest mouse in the PS/2 port continues to send 3-byte
    packets.

    Don't remove the shared memory segment when DEVICE_CLOSE is
    received. When exiting a KDE session in FC2, DEVICE_CLOSE is sent to
    the synaptics driver, but the X server doesn't quit. Therefore, the
    driver will use a stale memory area afterwards, which can cause X
    server crashes and prevent synclient from working.

Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
Date:   Wed Nov 12 20:49:36 2003 +0100

    Replaced the oneFinger, twoFingers and threeFingers
    variables in SynapticsHwState with a single variable numFingers. This
    is more logical, the old variables only existed because of
    implementation details in the 2.6 kernel interface.

    specified protocol. Problem reported by Anders Kaseorg

Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 25 01:37:13 2003 +0200

    Added support for the new 2.6 kernel events ABS_TOOL_WIDTH,
    BTN_TOOL_FINGER, BTN_TOOL_DOUBLETAP and BTN_TOOL_TRIPLETAP. Note that
    this swaps the direction of the Y axis internally to match X and the
    linux input subsystem. Because of this, the TopEdge and BottomEdge
    parameters must be modified in the config file. There is some backwards
    compatibility code for old 2.5/2.6 kernels that will probably be
    deleted later.

    Reset the touchpad if it has been out of sync for too long.
    (By Hartwig Felger, cleaned up somewhat by me.) The synaptics manual
    explains that the touchpad can revert to relative mode after a power
    glitch or electrostatic discharge.

Date:   Thu Jul 31 02:16:20 2003 +0200

    Disable stream mode before trying to identify/initialize the
    touchpad. Otherwise the touchpad can report motion data in the middle
    of the initialization sequence, which will confuse the driver and make
    the initialization fail.

    When setting the mode byte, don't set bits that the touchpad
    doesn't understand. (Those bits are reserved and setting them can lead
    to weird problems, like the left button not working, as reported by
    Miles Lane.)

    More robust resynchronization code, after an idea from
    Hartwig Felger. When we realize we are out of sync, only throw away
    one byte, not all bytes already read from the touchpad.

    * Added "multi-buttons" to the FEATURES list.
    * Updated NEWS file with data from the web page.
    * More robust parsing of the Handlers= line when doing auto detection
      for 2.6 kernels. ("Handlers=event2 js0" should now work.)
    * Updated synclient program to explain that it can't query hardware
      details when using a 2.6 kernel.

    Implemented protocol "auto-dev" that automatically tries to
    find the proper device node and protocol for the touchpad. This makes
    it possible to have the same XF86Config file for 2.4 and 2.5 kernels.
    From Hartwig Felger with some fixes by me.

Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
Date:   Thu Jun 19 01:19:38 2003 +0200

    Rewrote timer handling so that the driver no longer depends
    on packets arriving 1s after the last state change. (The kernel driver
    only reports to user space when something changes.) Use wall clock time
    instead of packet counting for time computations. This change also
    means that configurable times are now specified in milliseconds instead
    of units of 1/80s.

    Abstracted out the code to determine the hardware state
    from the ReadInput() function. This will make it possible to support
    the event based absolute packet format generated by the 2.5 kernel.

    Better state machine for handling middle mouse button
    emulation.
    * Clicks shorter than EmulateMidButtonTime are no longer lost.
    * The middle button event is generated as soon as both the left and the
      right buttons are pressed. The old code waited until the timeout had
      passed before even checking if both buttons were pressed.

Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
Date:   Fri May 2 01:53:37 2003 +0200

    Fixed removal of old shared memory segment before trying to
    create the new segment. This made X server startup fail if the memory
    segment size had been changed. (The first argument to xf86shmget is an
    shmid, not a key.)

Date:   Fri May 2 01:12:03 2003 +0200

    Build improvements.
    * Build synclient by default.
    * Made it possible to build synclient even if an X source tree is not
      available.
    * Added Makefile dependencies so that things get recompiled when a
      header file is changed.
    * synclient.c now includes synaptics.h instead of duplicating the
      shared memory segment definitions.

    Make double click processing from change
    4cc36ca33128f17be57e3a58a44374d9558fbfe9 more reliable.
    In the old code, a very short click could generate a single click
    instead of a double click.

Author: Peter Osterlund <petero2@telia.com>
Date:   Thu Jul 4 21:10:55 2002 +0200

    When doing tap, drag and double tap processing, the buttons
    not involved in the tapping was considered released, even if the
    corresponding physical button was pressed. This generated a bogus
    button release event when the tap processing started and a bogus button
    press event when the tap processing ended.

      area. Updated synclient to report the new information.
    * Improved synclient to only report when something changes.
