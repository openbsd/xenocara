DESCRIPTION

   Fontconfig is a library designed to provide system-wide font
   configuration, customization and application access.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW

   Fontconfig contains two essential modules, the configuration module which
   builds an internal configuration from XML files and the matching module
   which accepts font patterns and returns the nearest matching font.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FONT CONFIGURATION

   The configuration module consists of the FcConfig datatype, libexpat and
   FcConfigParse which walks over an XML tree and amends a configuration with
   data found within. From an external perspective, configuration of the
   library consists of generating a valid XML tree and feeding that to
   FcConfigParse. The only other mechanism provided to applications for
   changing the running configuration is to add fonts and directories to the
   list of application-provided font files.

   The intent is to make font configurations relatively static, and shared by
   as many applications as possible. It is hoped that this will lead to more
   stable font selection when passing names from one application to another.
   XML was chosen as a configuration file format because it provides a format
   which is easy for external agents to edit while retaining the correct
   structure and syntax.

   Font configuration is separate from font matching; applications needing to
   do their own matching can access the available fonts from the library and
   perform private matching. The intent is to permit applications to pick and
   choose appropriate functionality from the library instead of forcing them
   to choose between this library and a private configuration mechanism. The
   hope is that this will ensure that configuration of fonts for all
   applications can be centralized in one place. Centralizing font
   configuration will simplify and regularize font installation and
   customization.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FONT PROPERTIES

   While font patterns may contain essentially any properties, there are some
   well known properties with associated types. Fontconfig uses some of these
   properties for font matching and font completion. Others are provided as a
   convenience for the application's rendering mechanism.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Datatypes

   Fontconfig uses abstract data types to hide internal implementation
   details for most data structures. A few structures are exposed where
   appropriate.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcChar8, FcChar16, FcChar32, FcBool

   These are primitive data types; the FcChar* types hold precisely the
   number of bits stated (if supported by the C implementation). FcBool holds
   one of two C preprocessor symbols: FcFalse or FcTrue.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcMatrix

   An FcMatrix holds an affine transformation, usually used to reshape
   glyphs. A small set of matrix operations are provided to manipulate these.

           typedef struct _FcMatrix {
                   double xx, xy, yx, yy;
           } FcMatrix;


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcCharSet

   An FcCharSet is an abstract type that holds the set of encoded Unicode
   chars in a font. Operations to build and compare these sets are provided.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcLangSet

   An FcLangSet is an abstract type that holds the set of languages supported
   by a font. Operations to build and compare these sets are provided. These
   are computed for a font based on orthographic information built into the
   fontconfig library. Fontconfig has orthographies for all of the ISO 639-1
   languages except for MS, NA, PA, PS, QU, RN, RW, SD, SG, SN, SU and ZA. If
   you have orthographic information for any of these languages, please
   submit them.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcLangResult

   An FcLangResult is an enumeration used to return the results of comparing
   two language strings or FcLangSet objects. FcLangEqual means the objects
   match language and territory. FcLangDifferentTerritory means the objects
   match in language but differ in territory. FcLangDifferentLang means the
   objects differ in language.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcType

   Tags the kind of data stored in an FcValue.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcValue

   An FcValue object holds a single value with one of a number of different
   types. The 'type' tag indicates which member is valid.

           typedef struct _FcValue {
                   FcType type;
                   union {
                           const FcChar8 *s;
                           int i;
                           FcBool b;
                           double d;
                           const FcMatrix *m;
                           const FcCharSet *c;
                           void *f;
                           const FcLangSet *l;
                   } u;
           } FcValue;


                     FcValue Members

           Type            Union member    Datatype
           --------------------------------
           FcTypeVoid      (none)          (none)
           FcTypeInteger   i               int
           FcTypeDouble    d               double
           FcTypeString    s               FcChar8 *
           FcTypeBool      b               b
           FcTypeMatrix    m               FcMatrix *
           FcTypeCharSet   c               FcCharSet *
           FcTypeFTFace    f               void * (FT_Face)
           FcTypeLangSet   l               FcLangSet *


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcPattern

   holds a set of names with associated value lists; each name refers to a
   property of a font. FcPatterns are used as inputs to the matching code as
   well as holding information about specific fonts. Each property can hold
   one or more values; conventionally all of the same type, although the
   interface doesn't demand that.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcFontSet

           typedef struct _FcFontSet {
                   int nfont;
                   int sfont;
                   FcPattern **fonts;
           } FcFontSet;


   An FcFontSet contains a list of FcPatterns. Internally fontconfig uses
   this data structure to hold sets of fonts. Externally, fontconfig returns
   the results of listing fonts in this format. 'nfont' holds the number of
   patterns in the 'fonts' array; 'sfont' is used to indicate the size of
   that array.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcStrSet, FcStrList

   FcStrSet holds a list of strings that can be appended to and enumerated.
   Its unique characteristic is that the enumeration works even while strings
   are appended during enumeration. FcStrList is used during enumeration to
   safely and correctly walk the list of strings even while that list is
   edited in the middle of enumeration.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcObjectSet

           typedef struct _FcObjectSet {
                   int nobject;
                   int sobject;
                   const char **objects;
           } FcObjectSet;


   holds a set of names and is used to specify which fields from fonts are
   placed in the the list of returned patterns when listing fonts.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcObjectType

           typedef struct _FcObjectType {
                   const char *object;
                   FcType type;
           } FcObjectType;


   marks the type of a pattern element generated when parsing font names.
   Applications can add new object types so that font names may contain the
   new elements.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcConstant

           typedef struct _FcConstant {
               const FcChar8 *name;
               const char *object;
               int value;
           } FcConstant;


   Provides for symbolic constants for new pattern elements. When 'name' is
   seen in a font name, an 'object' element is created with value 'value'.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcBlanks

   holds a list of Unicode chars which are expected to be blank; unexpectedly
   blank chars are assumed to be invalid and are elided from the charset
   associated with the font.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcFileCache

   holds the per-user cache information for use while loading the font
   database. This is built automatically for the current configuration when
   that is loaded. Applications must always pass '0' when one is requested.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcConfig

   holds a complete configuration of the library; there is one default
   configuration, other can be constructed from XML data structures. All
   public entry points that need global data can take an optional FcConfig*
   argument; passing 0 uses the default configuration. FcConfig objects hold
   two sets of fonts, the first contains those specified by the
   configuration, the second set holds those added by the application at
   run-time. Interfaces that need to reference a particular set use one of
   the FcSetName enumerated values.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcSetName

   Specifies one of the two sets of fonts available in a configuration;
   FcSetSystem for those fonts specified in the configuration and
   FcSetApplication which holds fonts provided by the application.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcResult

   Used as a return type for functions manipulating FcPattern objects.

         FcResult Values
           Result Code             Meaning
           -----------------------------------------------------------
           FcResultMatch           Object exists with the specified ID
           FcResultNoMatch         Object doesn't exist at all
           FcResultTypeMismatch    Object exists, but the type doesn't match
           FcResultNoId            Object exists, but has fewer values
                                   than specified
           FcResultOutOfMemory     malloc failed


   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcAtomic

   Used for locking access to configuration files. Provides a safe way to
   update configuration files.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

  FcCache

   Holds information about the fonts contained in a single directory. Normal
   applications need not worry about this as caches for font access are
   automatically managed by the library. Applications dealing with cache
   management may want to use some of these objects in their work, however
   the included 'fc-cache' program generally suffices for all of that.

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                 FcPatternBuild

Name

   FcPatternBuild, FcPatternVaBuild, FcPatternVapBuild -- Create patterns
   from arguments

Synopsis

   #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>


   FcPattern * FcPatternBuild(FcPattern *pattern, ...);

   FcPattern * FcPatternVaBuild(FcPattern *pattern, va_list va);

   void FcPatternVapBuild(FcPattern *result, FcPattern *pattern, va_list va);

Description

   Builds a pattern using a list of objects, types and values. Each value to
   be entered in the pattern is specified with three arguments:

    1. Object name, a string describing the property to be added.

    2. Object type, one of the FcType enumerated values

    3. Value, not an FcValue, but the raw type as passed to any of the
       FcPatternAdd<type> functions. Must match the type of the second
       argument.

   The argument list is terminated by a null object name, no object type nor
   value need be passed for this. The values are added to `pattern', if
   `pattern' is null, a new pattern is created. In either case, the pattern
   is returned. Example

   pattern = FcPatternBuild (0, FC_FAMILY, FcTypeString, "Times", (char *) 0);

   FcPatternVaBuild is used when the arguments are already in the form of a
   varargs value. FcPatternVapBuild is a macro version of FcPatternVaBuild
   which returns its result directly in the result variable.

Version

                                FcPatternFormat

Name

   FcPatternFormat -- Format a pattern into a string according to a format
   specifier

Synopsis

   #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>


   FcChar8 * FcPatternFormat(FcPattern *pat, const FcChar8 *format);

Description

   Converts given pattern pat into text described by the format specifier
   format. The return value refers to newly allocated memory which should be
   freed by the caller using free(), or NULL if format is invalid.

    The format is loosely modeled after printf-style format string. The
   format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters
   (not "%"), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and tags which
   are interpreted to construct text from the pattern in a variety of ways
   (explained below). Special characters can be escaped using backslash.
   C-string style special characters like \n and \r are also supported (this
   is useful when the format string is not a C string literal). It is
   advisable to always escape curly braces that are meant to be copied to the
   output as ordinary characters.

    Each tag is introduced by the character "%", followed by an optional
   minimum field width, followed by tag contents in curly braces ({}). If the
   minimum field width value is provided the tag will be expanded and the
   result padded to achieve the minimum width. If the minimum field width is
   positive, the padding will right-align the text. Negative field width will
   left-align. The rest of this section describes various supported tag
   contents and their expansion.

    A simple tag is one where the content is an identifier. When simple tags
   are expanded, the named identifier will be looked up in pattern and the
   resulting list of values returned, joined together using comma. For
   example, to print the family name and style of the pattern, use the format
   "%{family} %{style}\n". To extend the family column to forty characters
   use "%-40{family}%{style}\n".

    Simple tags expand to list of all values for an element. To only choose
   one of the values, one can index using the syntax "%{elt[idx]}". For
   example, to get the first family name only, use "%{family[0]}".

    If a simple tag ends with "=" and the element is found in the pattern,
   the name of the element followed by "=" will be output before the list of
   values. For example, "%{weight=}" may expand to the string "weight=80". Or
   to the empty string if pattern does not have weight set.

    If a simple tag starts with ":" and the element is found in the pattern,
   ":" will be printed first. For example, combining this with the =, the
   format "%{:weight=}" may expand to ":weight=80" or to the empty string if
   pattern does not have weight set.

    If a simple tag contains the string ":-", the rest of the the tag
   contents will be used as a default string. The default string is output if
   the element is not found in the pattern. For example, the format
   "%{:weight=:-123}" may expand to ":weight=80" or to the string
   ":weight=123" if pattern does not have weight set.

    A count tag is one that starts with the character "#" followed by an
   element name, and expands to the number of values for the element in the
   pattern. For example, "%{#family}" expands to the number of family names
   pattern has set, which may be zero.

    A sub-expression tag is one that expands a sub-expression. The tag
   contents are the sub-expression to expand placed inside another set of
   curly braces. Sub-expression tags are useful for aligning an entire
   sub-expression, or to apply converters (explained later) to the entire
   sub-expression output. For example, the format "%40{{%{family} %{style}}}"
   expands the sub-expression to construct the family name followed by the
   style, then takes the entire string and pads it on the left to be at least
   forty characters.

    A filter-out tag is one starting with the character "-" followed by a
   comma-separated list of element names, followed by a sub-expression
   enclosed in curly braces. The sub-expression will be expanded but with a
   pattern that has the listed elements removed from it. For example, the
   format "%{-size,pixelsize{sub-expr}}" will expand "sub-expr" with pattern
   sans the size and pixelsize elements.

    A filter-in tag is one starting with the character "+" followed by a
   comma-separated list of element names, followed by a sub-expression
   enclosed in curly braces. The sub-expression will be expanded but with a
   pattern that only has the listed elements from the surrounding pattern.
   For example, the format "%{+family,familylang{sub-expr}}" will expand
   "sub-expr" with a sub-pattern consisting only the family and family lang
   elements of pattern.

    A conditional tag is one starting with the character "?" followed by a
   comma-separated list of element conditions, followed by two sub-expression
   enclosed in curly braces. An element condition can be an element name, in
   which case it tests whether the element is defined in pattern, or the
   character "!" followed by an element name, in which case the test is
   negated. The conditional passes if all the element conditions pass. The
   tag expands the first sub-expression if the conditional passes, and
   expands the second sub-expression otherwise. For example, the format
   "%{?size,dpi,!pixelsize{pass}{fail}}" will expand to "pass" if pattern has
   size and dpi elements but no pixelsize element, and to "fail" otherwise.

    An enumerate tag is one starting with the string "[]" followed by a
   comma-separated list of element names, followed by a sub-expression
   enclosed in curly braces. The list of values for the named elements are
   walked in parallel and the sub-expression expanded each time with a
   pattern just having a single value for those elements, starting from the
   first value and continuing as long as any of those elements has a value.
   For example, the format "%{[]family,familylang{%{family}
   (%{familylang})\n}}" will expand the pattern "%{family} (%{familylang})\n"
   with a pattern having only the first value of the family and familylang
   elements, then expands it with the second values, then the third, etc.

    As a special case, if an enumerate tag has only one element, and that
   element has only one value in the pattern, and that value is of type
   FcLangSet, the individual languages in the language set are enumerated.

    A builtin tag is one starting with the character "=" followed by a
   builtin name. The following builtins are defined:

   unparse

           Expands to the result of calling FcNameUnparse() on the pattern.

   fcmatch

           Expands to the output of the default output format of the fc-match
           command on the pattern, without the final newline.

   fclist

           Expands to the output of the default output format of the fc-list
           command on the pattern, without the final newline.

   fccat

           Expands to the output of the default output format of the fc-cat
           command on the pattern, without the final newline.

   pkgkit

           Expands to the list of PackageKit font() tags for the pattern.
           Currently this includes tags for each family name, and each
           language from the pattern, enumerated and sanitized into a set of
           tags terminated by newline. Package management systems can use
           these tags to tag their packages accordingly.

   For example, the format "%{+family,style{%{=unparse}}}\n" will expand to
   an unparsed name containing only the family and style element values from
   pattern.

    The contents of any tag can be followed by a set of zero or more
   converters. A converter is specified by the character "|" followed by the
   converter name and arguments. The following converters are defined:

   basename

           Replaces text with the results of calling FcStrBasename() on it.

   dirname

           Replaces text with the results of calling FcStrDirname() on it.

   downcase

           Replaces text with the results of calling FcStrDowncase() on it.

   shescape

           Escapes text for one level of shell expansion. (Escapes
           single-quotes, also encloses text in single-quotes.)

   cescape

           Escapes text such that it can be used as part of a C string
           literal. (Escapes backslash and double-quotes.)

   xmlescape

           Escapes text such that it can be used in XML and HTML. (Escapes
           less-than, greater-than, and ampersand.)

   delete(chars)

           Deletes all occurrences of each of the characters in chars from
           the text. FIXME: This converter is not UTF-8 aware yet.

   escape(chars)

           Escapes all occurrences of each of the characters in chars by
           prepending it by the first character in chars. FIXME: This
           converter is not UTF-8 aware yet.

   translate(from,to)

           Translates all occurrences of each of the characters in from by
           replacing them with their corresponding character in to. If to has
           fewer characters than from, it will be extended by repeating its
           last character. FIXME: This converter is not UTF-8 aware yet.

   For example, the format "%{family|downcase|delete( )}\n" will expand to
   the values of the family element in pattern, lower-cased and with spaces
   removed.

   void FcFontSetPrint(FcFontSet *set);

Description

   This function is useful for diagnosing font related issues, printing the
   complete contents of every pattern in set. The format of the output is
   designed to be of help to users and developers, and may change at any
   time.

                                 FcFontSetSort

Name

   FcFontSetSort -- Add to a font set

Synopsis

   #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>


   FcFontSetSort(FcConfig *config, FcFontSet **sets, intnsets, FcPattern
   *pattern, FcBool trim, FcCharSet **csp, FcResult *result);

Description

   Returns the list of fonts from sets sorted by closeness to pattern. If
   trim is FcTrue, elements in the list which don't include Unicode coverage
   not provided by earlier elements in the list are elided. The union of
   Unicode coverage of all of the fonts is returned in csp, if csp is not
   NULL. This function should be called only after FcConfigSubstitute and
   FcDefaultSubstitute have been called for p; otherwise the results will not
   be correct.

   The returned FcFontSet references FcPattern structures which may be shared
   by the return value from multiple FcFontSort calls, applications cannot
   modify these patterns. Instead, they should be passed, along with pattern
   to FcFontRenderPrepare which combines them into a complete pattern.

   The FcFontSet returned by FcFontSetSort is destroyed by calling
   FcFontSetDestroy.

   An FcCharSet is a boolean array indicating a set of Unicode chars. Those
   associated with a font are marked constant and cannot be edited.
   FcCharSets may be reference counted internally to reduce memory
   consumption; this may be visible to applications as the result of
   FcCharSetCopy may return it's argument, and that CharSet may remain
   unmodifiable.

                                   FcFontList

Name

   FcFontList -- List fonts

Synopsis

   #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>


   FcFontSet * FcFontList(FcConfig *config, FcPattern *p, FcObjectSet *os);

Description

   Selects fonts matching p, creates patterns from those fonts containing
   only the objects in os and returns the set of unique such patterns. If
   config is NULL, the default configuration is checked to be up to date, and
   used.

                                FcConfigFilename

Name

   FcConfigFilename -- Find a config file

Synopsis

   #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>


   FcChar8 * FcConfigFilename(const FcChar8 *name);

Description

   Given the specified external entity name, return the associated filename.
   This provides applications a way to convert various configuration file
   references into filename form.

   A null or empty name indicates that the default configuration file should
   be used; which file this references can be overridden with the
   FONTCONFIG_FILE environment variable. Next, if the name starts with ~, it
   refers to a file in the current users home directory. Otherwise if the
   name doesn't start with '/', it refers to a file in the default
   configuration directory; the built-in default directory can be overridden
   with the FONTCONFIG_PATH environment variable.

Synopsis

   #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>


   FcBool FcConfigParseAndLoad(FcConfig *config, const FcChar8 *file, FcBool
   complain);

Description

   Walks the configuration in 'file' and constructs the internal
   representation in 'config'. Any include files referenced from within
   'file' will be loaded and parsed. If 'complain' is FcFalse, no warning
   will be displayed if 'file' does not exist. Error and warning messages
   will be output to stderr. Returns FcFalse if some error occurred while
   loading the file, either a parse error, semantic error or allocation
   failure. Otherwise returns FcTrue.

                                   FcFileScan

Name

   FcFileScan -- scan a font file

Synopsis

   #include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>


   FcBool FcFileScan(FcFontSet *set, FcStrSet *dirs, FcFileCache *cache,
   FcBlanks *blanks, const FcChar8 *file, FcBool force);

Description

   Scans a single file and adds all fonts found to set. If force is FcTrue,
   then the file is scanned even if associated information is found in cache.
   If file is a directory, it is added to dirs. Whether fonts are found
   depends on fontconfig policy as well as the current configuration.
   Internally, fontconfig will ignore BDF and PCF fonts which are not in
   Unicode (or the effectively equivalent ISO Latin-1) encoding as those are
   not usable by Unicode-based applications. The configuration can ignore
   fonts based on filename or contents of the font file itself. Returns
   FcFalse if any of the fonts cannot be added (due to allocation failure).
   Otherwise returns FcTrue.

   FcBool FcDirScan(FcFontSet *set, FcStrSet *dirs, FcFileCache *cache,
   FcBlanks *blanks, const FcChar8 *dir, FcBool force);

Description

   If cache is not zero or if force is FcFalse, this function currently
   returns FcFalse. Otherwise, it scans an entire directory and adds all
   fonts found to set. Any subdirectories found are added to dirs. Calling
   this function does not create any cache files. Use FcDirCacheRead() if
   caching is desired.

Description

   This function now does nothing aside from returning FcFalse. It used to
   creates the per-directory cache file for dir and populates it with the
   fonts in set and subdirectories in dirs. All of this functionality is now
   automatically managed by FcDirCacheLoad and FcDirCacheRead.
