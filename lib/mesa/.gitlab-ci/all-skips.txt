# This test checks the driver's reported conformance version against the
# version of the CTS we're running. This check fails every few months
# and everyone has to go and bump the number in every driver.
# Running this check only makes sense while preparing a conformance
# submission, so skip it in the regular CI.

# These are tremendously slow (pushing toward a minute), and aren't
# reliable to be run in parallel with other tests due to CPU-side timing.

# These are sensitive to CPU timing, and would need to be run in isolation

# These tests all read from the front buffer after a swap.  Given that we
# run piglit tests in parallel in Mesa CI, and don't have a compositor
# running, the frontbuffer reads may end up with undefined results from
# windows overlapping us.
#
# Piglit does mark these tests as not to be run in parallel, but deqp-runner
# doesn't respect that.  We need to extend deqp-runner to allow some tests to be
# marked as single-threaded and run after the rayon loop if we want to support
# them.
#
# Note that "glx-" tests don't appear in x11-skips.txt because they can be
# run even if PIGLIT_PLATFORM=gbm (for example)
