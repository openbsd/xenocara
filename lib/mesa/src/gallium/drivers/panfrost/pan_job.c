/* panfrost_bo_access is here to help us keep track of batch accesses to BOs
 * and build a proper dependency graph such that batches can be pipelined for
 * better GPU utilization.
 *
 * Each accessed BO has a corresponding entry in the ->accessed_bos hash table.
 * A BO is either being written or read at any time, that's what the type field
 * encodes.
 * When the last access is a write, the batch writing the BO might have read
 * dependencies (readers that have not been executed yet and want to read the
 * previous BO content), and when the last access is a read, all readers might
 * depend on another batch to push its results to memory. That's what the
 * readers/writers keep track off.
 * There can only be one writer at any given time, if a new batch wants to
 * write to the same BO, a dependency will be added between the new writer and
 * the old writer (at the batch level), and panfrost_bo_access->writer will be
 * updated to point to the new writer.
