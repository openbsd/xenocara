/**
 * Shaders commonly contain small UBO loads with a constant offset scattered
 * throughout the program.  Ideally, we want to vectorize those into larger
 * block loads so we can load whole cachelines at a time, or at least fill
 * whole 32B registers rather than having empty space.
 *
 * nir_opt_load_store_vectorize() is terrific for combining small loads into
 * nice large block loads.  Unfortunately, it only vectorizes within a single
 * basic block, and there's a lot of opportunity for optimizing globally.
 *
 * In the past, our backend loaded whole 64B cachelines at a time (on pre-Xe2,
 * two registers) and rounded down constant UBO load offsets to the nearest
 * multiple of 64B.  This meant multiple loads within the same 64B would be
 * CSE'd into the same load, and we could even take advantage of global CSE.
 * However, we didn't have a method for shrinking loads from 64B back to 32B
 * again, and also didn't have a lot of flexibility in how this interacted
 * with the NIR load/store vectorization.
 *
 * This pass takes a similar approach, but in NIR.  The idea is to:
 *
 * 1. Run load/store vectorization to combine access within a basic block
 *
 * 2. Find load_ubo_uniform_block_intel intrinsics with constant offsets.
 *    Round their base down to the nearest multiple of 64B, and also increase
 *    their returned vector to be a vec16 (64B for 32-bit values).  However,
 *    only do this if a single vec16 load would cover this additional "pad"
 *    space at the front, and all used components of the existing load.  That
 *    way, we don't blindly turn a single load into two loads.
 *
 *    If we made any progress, then...
 *
 * 3. Run global CSE.  This will coalesce any accesses to the same 64B
 *    region across subtrees of the CFG.
 *
 * 4. Run the load/store vectorizer again for UBOs.  This will clean up
 *    any overlapping memory access within a block.
 *
 * 5. Have the backend only issue loads for components of the vec16 which
 *    are actually read.  We could also shrink this in NIR, but doing it in
 *    the backend is pretty straightforward.
 *
 * We could probably do better with a fancier sliding-window type pass
 * which looked across blocks to produce optimal loads.  However, this
 * simple hack using existing passes does a fairly good job for now.
