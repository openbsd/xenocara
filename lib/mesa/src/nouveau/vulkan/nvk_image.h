/* Because small images can end up with an array_stride_B that is less than
 * the sparse block size (in bytes), we have to set SINGLE_MIPTAIL_BIT when
 * advertising sparse properties to the client.  This means that we get one
 * single memory range for the miptail of the image.  For large images with
 * mipTailStartLod > 0, we have to deal with the array stride ourselves.
 *
 * We do this by returning NVK_MIP_TAIL_START_OFFSET as the image's
 * imageMipTailOffset.  We can then detect anything with that address as
 * being part of the miptail and re-map it accordingly.  The Vulkan spec
 * explicitly allows for this.
 *
 * From the Vulkan 1.3.279 spec:
 *
 *    "When VK_SPARSE_MEMORY_BIND_METADATA_BIT is present, the resourceOffset
 *    must have been derived explicitly from the imageMipTailOffset in the
 *    sparse resource properties returned for the metadata aspect. By
 *    manipulating the value returned for imageMipTailOffset, the
 *    resourceOffset does not have to correlate directly to a device virtual
 *    address offset, and may instead be whatever value makes it easiest for
 *    the implementation to derive the correct device virtual address."
