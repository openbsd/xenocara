Constructs patterns found in 'file'.
If id is -1, then all patterns found in 'file' are added to 'set'.
Otherwise, this function works exactly like FcFreeTypeQuery().

The number of patterns added to 'set' is returned.
FcBlanks is deprecated, \fIblanks\fR is ignored and
accepted only for compatibility with older code.
