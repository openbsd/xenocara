.SH NAME
FcConfigReference \- Increment config reference count
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>
.sp
FcConfig * FcConfigReference (FcConfig *\fIconfig\fB);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Add another reference to \fIconfig\fR\&. Configs are freed only
when the reference count reaches zero.
If \fIconfig\fR is NULL, the current configuration is used.
In that case this function will be similar to FcConfigGetCurrent() except that
it increments the reference count before returning and the user is responsible
for destroying the configuration when not needed anymore.
