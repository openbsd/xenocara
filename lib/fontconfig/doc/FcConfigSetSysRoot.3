.SH NAME
FcConfigSetSysRoot \- Set the system root directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fB#include <fontconfig/fontconfig.h>
.sp
void FcConfigSetSysRoot (FcConfig *\fIconfig\fB, const FcChar8 *\fIsysroot\fB);
\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Set 'sysroot' as the system root directory. All file paths used or created with
this 'config' (including file properties in patterns) will be considered or
made relative to this 'sysroot'. This allows a host to generate caches for
targets at build time. This also allows a cache to be re-targeted to a
different base directory if 'FcConfigGetSysRoot' is used to resolve file paths.
When setting this on the current config this causes changing current config
(calls FcConfigSetCurrent()).
