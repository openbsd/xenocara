    If EAGAIN == EWOULDBLOCK, only need to check errno for one of them
    
    Solaris <sys/errno.h> has:
     #define EWOULDBLOCK       EAGAIN
    so checking (errno == EAGAIN || errno == EWOULDBLOCK) is overkill.
    
    This leads cppcheck 1.62 to complain:
    [FSlibInt.c:153] -> [FSlibInt.c:153]: (style) Same expression on both sides of '||'.
    [FSlibInt.c:301] -> [FSlibInt.c:301]: (style) Same expression on both sides of '||'.

    [FSlibInt.c:472] -> [FSlibInt.c:472]: (style) Same expression on both sides of '||'.
    
    This quiets it, and reduces the number of calls Solaris Studio cc
    generates to the __errno() function to get the thread-specific errno value.

    Avoid reading outside bounds when _FSReply receives an Error response
    
    Upon receiving a response, _FSReply copies the first 8 bytes into *rep
    and then looks at them to determine what type of response.   If it's an
    error packet, it then converts to an error struct and reads the rest,
    but it was copying 16 bytes out of *rep to begin with, due to sloppy
    casting.   Since we immediately overwrite the second 8 bytes with the
    data coming off the wire, this isn't horrible, but it really freaks out
    static analysis and memory debugging tools.

    system headers causes the noreturn attribute to not be correctly
    applied to the exit() prototype in <stdlib.h> when building with
    Studio instead of gcc.
    
    Otherwise compiler exits with error:
    "FSlibInt.c", line 976: Function has no return statement : _FSDefaultIOError
    
    Uses Studio-specific pragma instead of adding another exit() prototype
    with a noreturn attribute to avoid causing gcc to warn about having
    a redundant prototype for the exit() function.

    Change FSOpenServer and FSServerName to take const char * args.
    
    Almost matches the current versions of the XOpenDisplay & XDisplayName
    functions they're modeled on - unlike XDisplayName, FSServerName now
    returns const char * as well so we don't lose the constness of the
    string passed in if we return it.

    As an interim measure, replace AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([dist-bzip2]) with
    AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([foreign dist-bzip2]). This will prevent the generation

Date:   Wed Jul 13 07:27:15 2005 +0000

commit 905552dfa2af617780bc2cd4d14edad845c3203b
Author: Keith Packard <keithp@keithp.com>
Date:   Wed Jul 13 07:23:56 2005 +0000

    Make some minor source adjustments so that we don not need to use
        -D_XOPEN_SOURCE -D_BSD_SOURCE everywhere as this will leak out of the
        modular environment and into application build processes, potentially
        foulling up their compiles.

Date:   Sun Jul 3 07:00:55 2005 +0000

    Add Xtrans definitions (FONT_t, TRANS_CLIENT) to clean up warnings.
    Add XSERV_t, TRANS_SERVER, TRANS_REOPEN to quash warnings.
    Add #include <dix-config.h> or <xorg-config.h>, as appropriate, to all
        source files in the xserver/xorg tree, predicated on defines of
        HAVE_{DIX,XORG}_CONFIG_H. Change all Xfont includes to
        <X11/fonts/foo.h>.
