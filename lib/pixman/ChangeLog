    Instead of using rounding version of the 8-bit shift, logical shifts were used.
    Also, code used unnecessary multiplications, which could be avoided by packing

    spills on stack. Code is rewritten to address mentioned issues.

    MIPS: DSPr2: Fix bug in over_n_8888_8888_ca/over_n_8888_0565_ca routines
    
    After introducing new PRNG (pseudorandom number generator) a bug in two DSPr2
    routines was revealed. Bug manifested by wrong calculation in composite and
    glyph tests, which caused make check to fail for MIPS DSPr2 optimizations.
    
    Bug was in the calculation of the:
    *dst = over (src, *dst) when ma == 0xffffffff
    
    In this case src was not negated and shifted right by 24 bits, it was only
    negated. When implementing this routine in the first place, I missplaced those
    shifts, which alowed me to combine code for over operation and:
        UN8x4_MUL_UN8x4 (s, ma);
        UN8x4_MUL_UN8 (ma, srca);
        ma = ~ma;
        UN8x4_MUL_UN8x4_ADD_UN8x4 (d, ma, s);
    So I decided to rewrite that piece of code from scratch. I changed logic, so
    now assembly code mimics code from pixman-fast-path.c but processes two pixels
    at a time. This code should be easier to debug and maintain.
    
    The bug was revealed in commit b31a6962. Errors were detected by composite
    and glyph tests.

    sse2: faster bilinear interpolation (get rid of XOR instruction)
    
    The old code was calculating horizontal weights for right pixels
    in the following way (for simplicity assume 8-bit interpolation
    precision):
    
      Start with "x = vx" and do increment "x += ux" after each pixel.
      In this case right pixel weight for interpolation can be calculated
      as "((x >> 8) ^ 0xFF) + 1", which is the same as "256 - (x >> 8)".
    
    The new code instead:
    
      Starts with "x = -(vx + 1)", performs increment "x += -ux" after
      each pixel and calculates right weights as just "(x >> 8) + 1",
      eliminating the need for XOR operation in the inner loop.
    
    So we have one instruction less on the critical path. Benchmarks
    with "lowlevel-blt-bench -b src_8888_8888" using GCC 4.7.2 on
    x86-64 system and default optimizations:
    
    Intel Core i7 860 (2.8GHz):

    test: larger 0xFF/0x00 filled clusters in random images for blitters-test
    
    Current blitters-test program had difficulties detecting a bug in
    over_n_8888_8888_ca implementation for MIPS DSPr2:
    
        http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/pixman/2013-March/002645.html
    
    In order to hit the buggy code path, two consecutive mask values had
    to be equal to 0xFFFFFFFF because of loop unrolling. The current
    blitters-test generates random images in such a way that each byte
    has 25% probability for having 0xFF value. Hence each 32-bit mask
    value has ~0.4% probability for 0xFFFFFFFF. Because we are testing
    many compositing operations with many pixels, encountering at least
    one 0xFFFFFFFF mask value reasonably fast is not a problem. If a
    bug related to 0xFFFFFFFF mask value is artificialy introduced into
    over_n_8888_8888_ca generic C function, it gets detected on 675591
    iteration in blitters-test (out of 2000000).
    
    However two consecutive 0xFFFFFFFF mask values are much less likely
    to be generated, so the bug was missed by blitters-test.
    
    This patch addresses the problem by also randomly setting the 32-bit
    values in images to either 0xFFFFFFFF or 0x00000000 (also with 25%
    probability). It allows to have larger clusters of consecutive 0x00
    or 0xFF bytes in images which may have special shortcuts for handling
    them in unrolled or SIMD optimized code.

    Improve precision of calculations in pixman-gradient-walker.c
    
    The computations in pixman-gradient-walker.c currently take place at
    very limited 8 bit precision which results in quite visible artefacts
    in gradients. An example is the one produced by demos/linear-gradient
    which currently looks like this:
    
        http://i.imgur.com/kQbX8nd.png
    
    With the changes in this commit, the gradient looks like this:
    
        http://i.imgur.com/nUlyuKI.png

        http://people.freedesktop.org/~sandmann/gradients/after.png
    
    This patch computes pixels using floating point, but uses a faster
    algorithm, which makes up for the loss of performance.
    
    == Theory:
    
    In both the new and the old algorithm, the various gradient
    implementations compute a parameter x that indicates how far along the
    gradient the current scanline is. The current algorithm has a cache of
    the two color stops surrounding the last parameter; those are used in
    a SIMD-within-register fashion in this way:
    
        t1 = walker->left_rb * idist + walker->right_rb * dist;
    
    where dist and idist are the distances to the left and right color
    stops respectively normalized to the distance between the left and
    right stops. The normalization (which involves a division) is captured
    in another cached variable "stepper". The cached values are recomputed
    whenever the parameter moves in between two different stops (called
    "reset" in the implementation).
    
    Because idist and dist are computed in 8 bits only, a lot of
    information is lost, which is quite visible as the image linked above
    shows.
    
    The new algorithm caches more information in the following way. When
    interpolating between stops, the formula to be used is this:
    
         t = ((x - left) / (right - left));
    
         result = lc * (1 - t) + rc * t;
    
    where
    
        - x is the parameter as computed by the main gradient code,
        - left is the position of the left color stop,
        - right is the position of the right color stop
        - lc is the color of the left color stop
        - rc is the color of the right color stop
    
    That formula can also be written like this:
    
        result
          = lc * (1 - t) + rc * t;
          = lc + (rc - lc) * t
          = lc + (rc - lc) * ((x - left) / (right - left))
          = (rc - lc) / (right - left) * x +
          	       lc - (left * (rc - lc)) / (right - left)
          = s * x + b
    
    where
    
        s = (rc - lc) / (right - left)
    
    and
    
        b = lc - left * (rc - lc) / (right - left)
          = (lc * (right - left) - left * (rc - lc)) / (right - left)
          = (lc * right - rc * left) / (right - left)
    
    To summarize, setting w = (right - left):
    
        s = (rc - lc) / w
        b = (lc * right - rc * left) / w
    
        r = s * x + b
    
    Since s and b only depend on the two active stops, both can be cached
    so that the computation only needs to do one multiplication and one
    addition per pixel (followed by premultiplication of the alpha
    channel). That is, seven multiplications in total, which is the same
    number as the old SIMD-within-register implementation had.
    
    == Implementation notes:
    
    The new formula described above is implemented in single precision
    floating point, and the eight divisions necessary to compute the
    cached values are done by multiplication with the reciprocal of the
    distance between the color stops.
    
    The alpha values used in the cached computation are scaled by 255.0,
    whereas the RGB values are kept in the [0, 1] interval. The ensures
    that after premultiplication, all values will be in the [0, 255]
    interval.
    
    This scaling is done by first dividing all the all the channels by
    257, and then later on dividing the r, g, b channels by 255. It would
    be more natural to do all this scaling in only one place, but
    inexplicably, that results in a (substantial) slowdown on Sandy Bridge
    with GCC v 4.7.
    
    == Performance impact (median of three runs of radial-perf-test):
    
       == Intel Sandy Bridge, Core i3 @ 1.2GHz
    
       Before: 0.014553
       After:  0.014410
       Change: 1.0% faster

       Before: 0.021735
       After:  0.021328
       Change: 1.9% faster
    
    Ie., slightly faster, though conceivably there could be a negative
    impact on machines with a bigger difference between integer and
    floating point performance.
    
    V2:
    
    - Use 's' and 'b' in the variable names instead of 'm' and 'd'. This
      way they match the explanation above
    
    - Move variable declarations to the top of the function
    
    - Remove unused stepper field
    
    - Some formatting fixes
    
    - Don't pointlessly include pixman-combine32.h
    
    - Don't offset x for each pixel; go back to offsetting left_x and
      right_x at reset time. The offsets cancel out in the formula above,
      so there is no impact on the calcualations.

    gtk-utils.c: Use cairo in show_image() rather than GdkPixbuf
    
    GdkPixbufs are not premultiplied, so when using them to display pixman
    images, there is some unecessary conversions going on: First the image
    is converted to non-premultiplied, and then GdkPixbuf premultiplies
    before sending the result to the X server. These conversions may cause
    the displayed image to not be exactly identical to the original.
    
    This patch just uses a cairo image surface instead, which avoids these
    conversions.
    
    Also make the comment about sRGB a little more concise.

    Fix to lowlevel-blt-bench
    
    The source, mask and destination buffers are initialised to 0xCC just after
    they are allocated. Between each benchmark, there are a pair of memcpys,
    from the destination buffer to the source buffer and back again (there are
    no explanatory comments, but presumably this is an effort to flush the
    caches). However, it has an unintended consequence, which is to change the
    contents of the buffers on entry to subsequent benchmarks. This means it is
    not a fair test: for example, with over_n_8888 (featured in the following
    patches) it reports L2 and even M tests as being faster than the L1 test,
    because after the L1 test, the source buffer is filled with fully opaque
    pixels, for which over_n_8888 has a shortcut.
    
    The fix here is simply to reverse the order of the memcpys, so src and
    destination are both filled with 0xCC on entry to all tests.

    Turn on error logging at all times
    
    While releasing 0.29.2 the distcheck run produced a number of error
    messages that had to be fixed in 349015e1fc5d912ba4253133b90e751d0b.
    These were not caught before so nobody had actually run pixman with
    debugging turned on. It's not the first time this has happened, see
    5b0563f39eb29e4ae431717696174da5 for example.
    
    So this patch makes the return_if_fail() macros use unlikely() around
    the expressions and then turns on error logging at all times. The
    performance hit should negligible since we were already evaluating the
    expressions.
    
    The place where DEBUG actually does cause a performance hit is in the
    region selfcheck code, and that will still only be enabled in
    development snapshots.

    utils.c: Increase acceptable deviation to 0.0064 in pixel_checker_t
    
    The check-formats programs reveals that the 8 bit pipeline cannot meet
    the current 0.004 acceptable deviation specified in utils.c, so we
    have to increase it. Some of the failing pixels were captured in
    pixel-test, which with this commit now passes.
    
    == a4r4g4b4 DISJOINT_XOR a8r8g8b8 ==
    
    The DISJOINT_XOR operator applied to an a4r4g4b4 source pixel of
    0xd0c0 and a destination pixel of 0x5300ea00 results in the exact
    value:
    
        fa = (1 - da) / sa = (1 - 0x53 / 255.0) / (0xd / 15.0) = 0.7782
        fb = (1 - sa) / da = (1 - 0xd / 15.0) / (0x53 / 255.0) = 0.4096
    
        r = fa * (0xc / 15.0) + fb * (0xea / 255.0) = 0.99853
    
    But when computing in 8 bits, we get:
    
        fa8 = ((255 - 0x53) * 255 + 0xdd / 2) / 0xdd = 0xc6
        fb8 = ((255 - 0xdd) * 255 + 0x53 / 3) / 0x53 = 0x68
    
        r8 = (fa8 * 0xcc + 127) / 255 + (fb8 * 0xea + 127) / 255 = 0xfd
    
    and
    
        0xfd / 255.0 = 0.9921568627450981
    
    for a deviation of 0.00637118610187, which we then have to consider
    acceptable given the current implementation.
    
    By switching to computing the result with
    
       r = (fa * s + fb * d + 127) / 255
    
    rather than
    
       r = (fa * s + 127) / 255 + (fb * d + 127) / 255
    
    the deviation would be only 0.00244961747442, so at some point it may
    be worth doing either this, or switching to floating point for
    operators that involve divisions.
    
    Note that the conversion from 4 bits to 8 bits does not cause any
    error in this case because both rounding and bit replication produces
    an exact result when the number of from-bits divide the number of
    to-bits.
    
    == a8r8g8b8 OVER r5g6b5 ==
    
    When OVER compositing the a8r8g8b8 pixel 0x0f00c300 with the x14r6g6b6
    pixel 0x03c0, the true floating point value of the resulting green
    channel is:
    
       0xc3 / 255.0 + (1.0 - 0x0f / 255.0) * (0x0f / 63.0) = 0.9887955
    
    but when compositing 8 bit values, where the 6-bit green channel is
    converted to 8 bit through bit replication, the 8-bit result is:
    
       0xc3 + ((255 - 0x0f) * 0x3c + 127) / 255 = 251
    
    which corresponds to a real value of 0.984314. The difference from the
    true value is 0.004482 which is bigger than the acceptable deviation
    of 0.004. So, if we were to compute all the CONJOINT/DISJOINT
    operators in floating point, or otherwise make them more accurate, the
    acceptable deviation could be set at 0.0045.
    
    If we were doing the 6-bit conversion with rounding:
    
       (x / 63.0 * 255.0 + 0.5)
    
    instead of bit replication, the deviation in this particular case
    would be only 0.0005, so we may want to consider this at some
    point.

    test: Add new check-formats utility
    
    Given an operator and two formats, this program will composite and
    check all pixels where the red and blue channels are 0. That is, if
    the two formats are a8r8g8b8 and a4r4g4b4, all source pixels matching
    the mask
    
        0xff00ff00
    
    are composited with the given operator against all destination pixels
    matching the mask
    
        0xf0f0
    
    and the result is then verified against the do_composite() function
    that was moved to utils.c earlier.
    
    This program reveals that a number of operators and format
    combinations are not computed to within the precision currently
    accepted by pixel_checker_t. For example:
    
        check-formats over a8r8g8b8 r5g6b5 | grep failed | wc -l
        30
    
    reveals that there are 30 pixel combinations where OVER produces
    insufficiently precise results for the a8r8g8b8 and r5g6b5 formats.

    stresstest: Ensure that the rasterizer is only given alpha formats
    
    In c2cb303d33ec11390b93cabd90f0f9, return_if_fail()s were added to
    prevent the trapezoid rasterizers from being called with non-alpha
    formats. However, stress-test actually does call the rasterizers with
    non-alpha formats, but because _pixman_log_error() is disabled in
    versions with an odd minor number, the errors never materialized.
    
    Fix this by changing the argument to random format to an enum of three
    values DONT_CARE, PREFER_ALPHA, or REQUIRE_ALPHA, and then in the
    switch that calls the trapezoid rasterizers, pass the appropriate
    value for the function in question.

    Improve L1 and L2 benchmark tests for caches that don't use allocate-on-write
    
    In particular this affects single-core ARMs (e.g. ARM11, Cortex-A8), which
    are usually configured this way. For other CPUs, this should only add a
    constant time, which will be cancelled out by the EXCLUDE_OVERHEAD runs.
    
    The problems were caused by cachelines becoming permanently evicted from
    the cache, because the code that was intended to pull them back in again on
    each iteration assumed too long a cache line (for the L1 test) or failed to
    read memory beyond the first pixel row (for the L2 test). Also, the reloading
    of the source buffer was unnecessary.
    
    These issues were identified by Siarhei in this post:

    pixman-combine-float.c: Use IS_ZERO() in clip_color() and set_sat()
    
    The clip_color() function has some checks to avoid division by zero,
    but they are done by comparing the value to 4 * FLT_EPSILON, where a
    better choice is the IS_ZERO() macro that compares to +/- FLT_MIN.
    
    In set_sat(), the check is that *max > *min before dividing by *max -
    *min, but that has the potential problem that interactions between GCC
    optimizions and 80 bit x87 registers could mean that (*max > *min) is
    true in 80 bits, but (*max - *min) is 0 in 32 bits, so that the
    division by zero is not prevented. Using IS_ZERO() here as well
    prevents this.

    ARMv6: New blit routines
    
    These are usable either as various composite operations, or via the
    top-level function pixman_blt() which now does some blitting for the
    first time on an ARMv6 platform (previously it just returned FALSE).

    ARMv6: Lay the groundwork for later patches in the series
    
    Move the entire contents of pixman-arm-simd-asm.S to a new file;
    ultimately this will only retain the scaled operations, so it is
    named pixman-arm-simd-asm-scaled.S. Added new header file
    pixman-arm-simd-asm.h, containing the macros which are the basis of
    all the new ARMv6 implementations, although at this point in the
    series, nothing uses them and the library should be binary-identical.

    demo/scale: Add a spin button to set the number of subsample bits
    
    For large upscalings the level of subsampling for the filter has a
    quite visible effect, so make it settable in the UI so that people can
    experiment with various values.

    Use pixman_transform_point_31_16() from pixman_transform_point()
    
    Old functions pixman_transform_point() and pixman_transform_point_3d()
    now become just wrappers for pixman_transform_point_31_16() and
    pixman_transform_point_31_16_3d(). Eventually their uses should be
    completely eliminated in the pixman code and replaced with their
    extended range counterparts. This is needed in order to be able
    to correctly handle any matrices and parameters that may come
    to pixman from the code responsible for XRender implementation.

    test: Added matrix-test for testing projective transform accuracy
    
    This test uses __float128 data type when it is available
    for implementing a "perfect" reference implementation. The
    output from from pixman_transform_point_31_16() and
    pixman_transform_point_31_16_affine() is compared with the
    reference implementation to make sure that the rounding
    errors may only show up in a single least significant bit.
    
    The platforms and compilers, which do not support __float128
    data type, can rely on crc32 checksum for the pseudorandom
    transform results.

    GCC supports 128-bit floating point data type on some platforms (including
    but not limited to x86 and x86-64). This may be useful for tests, which
    need prefectly accurate reference implementations of certain algorithms.

    pixman_transform_point_31_16_3d() -
        Calculates the product of a matrix and a vector multiplication.
    
    pixman_transform_point_31_16() -
        Calculates the product of a matrix and a vector multiplication.
        Then converts the homogenous resulting vector [x, y, z] to
        cartesian [x', y', 1] variant, where x' = x / z, and y' = y / z.
    
    pixman_transform_point_31_16_affine() -
        A faster sibling of the other two functions, which assumes affine
        transformation, where the bottom row of the matrix is [0, 0, 1] and
        the last element of the input vector is set to 1.
    
    These functions transform a point with 31.16 fixed point coordinates from
    the destination space to a point with 48.16 fixed point coordinates in
    the source space.
    
    The results are accurate and the rounding errors may only show up in
    the least significant bit. No overflows are possible for the affine
    transformations as long as the input data is provided in 31.16 format.
    In the case of projective transformations, some output values may be not
    representable using 48.16 fixed point format. In this case the results
    are clamped to return maximum or minimum 48.16 values (so that the caller
    can at least handle NONE and PAD repeats correctly).

    Faster fetch for the C variant of r5g6b5 src/dest iterator
    
    Processing two pixels at once is used to reduce the number of
    arithmetic operations.
    
    The speedup relative to the generic fetch_scanline_r5g6b5() from
    "pixman-access.c" (pixman was compiled with gcc 4.7.2):

        Intel Core i7  2800MHz  : 257.02 MPix/s -> 376.93 MPix/s
    
    That's the performance for C code (SIMD and assembly optimizations
    are disabled via PIXMAN_DISABLE environment variable).

    Faster write-back for the C variant of r5g6b5 dest iterator
    
    Unrolling loops improves performance, so just use it here.
    
    Also GCC can't properly optimize this code for RISC processors and
    allocate 0x1F001F constant in a register. Because this constant is
    too large to be represented as an immediate operand in instructions,
    GCC inserts some redundant arithmetics. This problem can be workarounded
    by explicitly using a variable for 0x1F001F constant and also initializing
    it by a read from another volatile variable. In this case GCC is forced
    to allocate a register for it, because it is not seen as a constant anymore.
    
    The speedup relative to the generic store_scanline_r5g6b5() from
    "pixman-access.c" (pixman was compiled with gcc 4.7.2):

    Added C variants of r5g6b5 fetch/write-back iterators
    
    Adding specialized iterators for r5g6b5 color format allows us to work
    on fine tuning performance of r5g6b5 fetch/write-back operations in the
    pixman general "fetch -> combine -> store" pipeline.
    
    These iterators also make "src_x888_0565" fast path redundant, so it can
    be removed.

    Always return a valid function from lookup_composite()
    
    We never expect to fail to find the appropriate function as the
    general_composite_rect should always match. So if somehow we fallthrough
    the search, emit a _pixman_log_error() and return a dummy function.
    
    Note that we remove some conditionals and a level of indentation hence a
    large amount of code movement. This also reveals that in a few places we
    are duplicating stack variables that can be eliminated later.

    Tweaks to lowlevel-blt-bench
    
    This adds two extra tests, src_n_8 and src_8_8, which I have been
    using to benchmark my ARMv6 changes.
    
    I'd also like to propose that it requires an exact test name as the
    executable's argument, as achieved by this strstr to strcmp change.
    Without this, it is impossible to only benchmark (for example)
    add_8_8, add_n_8 or src_n_8, due to those also being substrings of
    many other test names.

    Handle solid images in the noop iterator
    
    The noop src iterator already has code to handle solid images, but
    that code never actually runs currently because it is not possible for
    an image to have both a format code of PIXMAN_solid and a flag of
    FAST_PATH_BITS_IMAGE.
    
    If these two were to be set at the same time, the
    fast_composite_tiled_repeat() fast path would trigger for solid images
    (because it triggers for PIXMAN_any formats, which includes
    PIXMAN_solid), but for solid images we can usually do better than that
    fast path.
    
    So this patch removes _pixman_solid_fill_iter_init() and instead
    handles such images (along with repeating 1x1 bits images without an
    alpha map) in pixman-noop.c.
    
    When a 1x1R image is involved in the general composite path, before
    this patch, it would hit this code in repeat() in pixman-inlines.h:
    
            while (*c >= size)
                *c -= size;
            while (*c < 0)
                *c += size;
    
    and those loops could run for a huge number of iteratons (proportional
    to the composite width). For such cases, the performance improvement
    is really big:

    float-combiner.c: Change tests for x == 0.0 tests to - FLT_MIN < x < FLT_MIN
    
    pixman-float-combiner.c currently uses checks like these:
    
        if (x == 0.0f)
            ...
        else
            ... / x;
    
    to prevent division by 0. In theory this is correct: a division-by-zero
    exception is only supposed to happen when the floating point numerator is
    exactly equal to a positive or negative zero.
    
    However, in practice, the combination of x87 and gcc optimizations
    causes issues. The x87 registers are 80 bits wide, which means the
    initial test:
    
    	if (x == 0.0f)
    
    may be false when x is an 80 bit floating point number, but when x is
    rounded to a 32 bit single precision number, it becomes equal to
    0.0. In principle, gcc should compensate for this quirk of x87, and
    there are some options such as -ffloat-store, -fexcess-precision=standard,
    and -std=c99 that will make it do so, but these all have a performance
    cost.  It is also possible to set the FPU to a mode that makes it do
    all computation with single or double precision, but that would
    require pixman to save the existing mode before doing anything with
    floating point and restore it afterwards.
    
    Instead, this patch side-steps the issue by replacing exact checks for
    equality with zero with a new macro that checkes whether the value is
    between -FLT_MIN and FLT_MIN.
    
    There is extensive reading material about this issue linked off the
    infamous gcc bug 323:

    ARM: make use of UQADD8 instruction even in generic C code paths
    
    ARMv6 has UQADD8 instruction, which implements unsigned saturated
    addition for 8-bit values packed in 32-bit registers. It is very useful
    for UN8x4_ADD_UN8x4, UN8_rb_ADD_UN8_rb and ADD_UN8 macros (which would
    otherwise need a lot of arithmetic operations to simulate this operation).
    Since most of the major ARM linux distros are built for ARMv7, we are
    much less dependent on runtime CPU detection and can get practical
    benefits from conditional compilation here for a lot of users.
    
    The results of cairo-perf-trace benchmark on ARM Cortex-A15 with pixman
    compiled by gcc 4.7.2 and PIXMAN_DISABLE set to "arm-simd arm-neon":

    Faster conversion from a8r8g8b8 to r5g6b5 in C code
    
    This change reduces 3 shifts, 3 ANDs and 2 ORs (total 8 arithmetic
    operations) to 3 shifts, 2 ANDs and 2 ORs (total 7 arithmetic
    operations).
    
    We get garbage in the high 16 bits of the result, which might need
    to be cleared when casting to uint16_t (it would bring us back to
    total 8 arithmetic operations). However in the case if the result
    of a8r8g8b8->r5g6b5 conversion is immediately stored to memory, no
    extra instructions for clearing these garbage bits are needed.
    
    This allows the a8r8g8b8->r5g6b5 conversion code to be compiled
    into 4 instructions for ARM instead of 5 (assuming a good optimizing
    compiler), which has no pipeline stalls on ARM11 as an additional
    bonus.
    
    The change in benchmark results for 'lowlevel-blt-bench src_8888_0565'
    with PIXMAN_DISABLE="arm-simd arm-neon mips-dspr2 mmx sse2" and pixman
    compiled by gcc-4.7.2:
    
        MIPS 74K        480MHz  :  40.44 MPix/s ->  40.13 MPix/s
        ARM11           700MHz  :  50.28 MPix/s ->  62.85 MPix/s
        ARM Cortex-A8  1000MHz  : 124.38 MPix/s -> 141.85 MPix/s

    pixman_composite_trapezoids: Return early if mask_format is not of TYPE_ALPHA
    
    stress-test -s 0x17ee crashes because pixman_composite_trapezoids() is
    given a mask_format of PIXMAN_c8, which causes it to create a
    temporary image with that format but without a palette. This causes
    crashes later.
    
    The only mask_format that we actually support are those of TYPE_ALPHA,
    so this patch add a return_if_fail() to ensure this.
    
    Similarly, although currently it won't crash if given an invalid
    format, alpha-only formats have always been the only thing that made
    sense for the pixman_rasterize_edges() functions, so add a
    return_if_fail() ensuring that the destination format is of type
    PIXMAN_TYPE_ALPHA.

    radial: When comparing t to mindr, use >= rather than >
    
    Radial gradients are conceptually rendered as a sequence of circles
    generated by linearly extrapolating from the two circles given by the
    gradient specification. Any circles in that sequence that would end up
    with a negative radius are not drawn, a condition that is enforced by
    checking that t * dr is bigger than mindr:
    
         if (t * dr > mindr)
    
    However, it is legitimate for a circle to have radius exactly 0, so
    the test should use >= rather than >.
    
    This gets rid of the dots in demos/radial-test except for when the c2
    circle has radius 0 and a repeat mode of either NONE or NORMAL. Both
    those dots correspond to a t value of 1.0, which is outside the
    defined interval of [0.0, 1.0) and therefore subject to the repeat
    algorithm. As a result, in the NONE case, a value of 1.0 turns into
    transparent black. In the NORMAL case, 1.0 wraps around and becomes
    0.0 which is red, unlike 0.99 which is blue.

    This new test is derived from radial-test.c and displays conical
    gradients at various angles.
    
    It also demonstrates how PIXMAN_REPEAT_NORMAL is supposed to work when
    used with a gradient specification where the first stop is not a 0.0:
    In this case the gradient is supposed to have a smooth transition from
    the last stop back to the first stop with no sharp transitions. It
    also shows that the repeat mode is not ignored for conical gradients
    as one might be tempted to think.

    The zone plate image is a useful test case for image scalers because
    it contains all representable frequencies, so any imperfection in
    resampling filters will show up as Moire patterns.
    
    This version is symmetric around the midpoint of the image, so since
    rotating it is supposed to be a noop, it can also be used to verify
    that the resampling filters don't shift the image.

    Add new pixman_filter_create_separable_convolution() API
    
    This new API is a helper function to create filter parameters suitable
    for use with PIXMAN_FILTER_SEPARABLE_CONVOLUTION.
    
    For each dimension, given a scale factor, reconstruction and sample
    filter kernels, and a subsampling resolution, this function will
    compute a convolution of the two kernels scaled appropriately, then
    sample that convolution and return the resulting vectors in a form
    suitable for being used as parameters to
    PIXMAN_FILTER_SEPARABLE_CONVOLUTION.
    
    The filter kernels offered are the following:
    
      - IMPULSE:            Dirac delta function, ie., point sampling
      - BOX:                Box filter
      - LINEAR:             Linear filter, aka. "Tent" filter
      - CUBIC:              Cubic filter, currently Mitchell-Netravali
      - GAUSSIAN:           Gaussian function, sigma=1, support=3*sigma
      - LANCZOS2:           Two-lobed Lanczos filter
      - LANCZOS3:           Three-lobed Lanczos filter
      - LANCZOS3_STRETCHED: Three-lobed Lanczos filter, stretched by 4/3.0.
                            This is the "Nice" filter from Dirty Pixels by
                            Jim Blinn.
    
    The intended way to use this function is to extract scaling factors
    from the transformation and then pass those to this function to get a
    filter suitable for compositing with that transformation. The filter
    kernels can be chosen according to quality and performance tradeoffs.
    
    To get equivalent quality to GdkPixbuf for downscalings, use BOX for
    both reconstruction and sampling. For upscalings, use LINEAR for
    reconstruction and IMPULSE for sampling (though note that for
    upscaling in both X and Y directions, simply using
    PIXMAN_FILTER_BILINEAR will likely be a better choice).

    Add new filter PIXMAN_FILTER_SEPARABLE_CONVOLUTION
    
    This filter is a new way to use a convolution matrix for filtering. In
    contrast to the existing CONVOLUTION filter, this new variant is
    different in two respects:
    
    - It is subsampled: Instead of just one convolution matrix, this
      filter chooses between a number of matrices based on the subpixel
      sample location, allowing the convolution kernel to be sampled at a
      higher resolution.
    
    - It is separable: Each matrix is specified as the tensor product of
      two vectors. This has the advantages that many fewer values have to
      be stored, and that the filtering can be done separately in the x
      and y dimensions (although the initial implementation doesn't
      actually do that).
    
    The motivation for this new filter is to improve image downsampling
    quality. Currently, the best pixman can do is the regular convolution
    filter which is limited to coarsely sampled convolution kernels.
    
    With this new feature, any separable filter can be used at any desired
    resolution.

    ignored with a warning by mingw-w64 [1] and silently ignored by clang [2].
    The resulting binary behaved as if PIXMAN_NO_TLS was defined.

    test: Added a better PRNG (pseudorandom number generator)
    
    This adds a fast SIMD-optimized variant of a small noncryptographic
    PRNG originally developed by Bob Jenkins:
        http://www.burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/smallprng.html
    
    The generated pseudorandom data is good enough to pass "Big Crush"
    tests from TestU01 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TestU01).
    
    SIMD code uses http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Vector-Extensions.html
    which is a GCC specific extension. There is also a slower alternative
    code path, which should work with any C compiler.
    
    The performance of filling buffer with random data:
       Intel Core i7  @2.8GHz (SSE2)     : ~5.9 GB/s
       ARM Cortex-A15 @1.7GHz (NEON)     : ~2.2 GB/s
       IBM Cell PPU   @3.2GHz (Altivec)  : ~1.7 GB/s

    test: Change is_little_endian() into inline function
    
    Also dropped redundant volatile keyword because any object
    can be accessed via char* pointer without breaking aliasing
    rules. The compilers are able to optimize this function to either
    constant 0 or 1.

    Add text file rounding.txt describing how rounding works
    
    It is not entirely obvious how pixman gets from "location in the
    source image" to "pixel value stored in the destination". This file
    describes how the filters work, and in particular how positions are
    rounded to samples.

commit 74319e9d39f5d7f85cb75fcb91343f298b0e62e2
Author: Søren Sandmann Pedersen <ssp@redhat.com>

    Convolution filter: round color values instead of truncating
    
    The pixel computed by the convolution filter should be rounded off,
    not truncated. As a simple example consider a convolution matrix
    consisting of five times 0x3333. If all five all five input pixels are
    0xff, then the result of truncating will be
    
        (5 * 0x3333 * 255) >> 16 = 254
    
    But the real value of the computation is (5 * 0x3333 / 65536.0) * 254
    = 254.9961, so the error is almost 1. If the user isn't very careful
    about normalizing the convolution kernel so that it sums to one in
    fixed point, such error might cause solid images to change color, or
    opaque images to become translucent.
    
    The fix is simply to round instead of truncate.

    Round fixed-point multiplication
    
    After two fixed-point numbers are multiplied, the result is shifted
    into place, but up until now pixman has simply discarded the low-order
    bits instead of rounding to the closest number.
    
    Fix that by adding 0x8000 (or 0x2 in one place) before shifting and
    update the test checksums to match.

    Always use xmmintrin.h for 64 bit Windows
    
    MinGW-w64 uses the GNU compiler and does not define _MSC_VER.
    Nevertheless, it provides xmmintrin.h and must be handled
    here like the MS compiler. Otherwise compilation fails due to
    conflicting declarations.

    Allow src and dst to be identical in pixman_f_transform_invert()
    
    It is useful to be able to invert a matrix in place, but currently
    pixman_f_transform_invert() will produce wrong results if you pass the
    same matrix as both source and destination.
    
    Fix that by inverting into a temporary matrix and then copying that to
    the destination.

    pixman_composite_trapezoids(): don't clip to extents for some operators
    
    pixman_composite_trapezoids() is supposed to composite across the
    entire destination, but it actually only composites across the extent
    of the trapezoids. For operators such as ADD or OVER this doesn't
    matter since a zero source has no effect on the destination. But for
    operators such as SRC or IN, it does matter.
    
    So for such operators where a zero source has an effect, don't clip to
    the trap extents.

    Add new pixman_image_create_bits_no_clear() API
    
    When pixman_image_create_bits() function is given NULL for bits, it
    will allocate a new buffer and initialize it to zero. However, in some
    cases, only a small region of the image is actually used; in that case
    it is wasteful to touch all of the memory.
    
    The new pixman_image_create_bits_no_clear() works exactly like
    _create_bits() except that it doesn't initialize any newly allocated
    memory.

    configure.ac: PIXMAN_LINK_WITH_ENV fix
    
    (fixes bug #52101)
    
    On MirBSD, the compiler produces a (harmless) warning when the compiler
    is called without the standard CFLAGS:
    
    foo.c:0: note: someone does not honour COPTS correctly, passed 0 times
    
    However, PIXMAN_LINK_WITH_ENV considers _any_ output on stderr as an
    error, even if the exit status of the compiler is 0. Furthermore, it
    resets CFLAGS and LDFLAGS at the start. On MirBSD, this will lead to a
    warning in each test, making all such tests fail. In particular, the
    pthread_setspecific test fails, thus pixman is compiled without thread
    support. This leads to compile errors later on, or at least it did when
    I tried this on pkgsrc. Re-adding the saved CFLAGS, LDFLAGS and LIBS
    before the test makes it work.
    
    The second hunk inverts the order of the pthread flag checks. On BSD
    systems (this is true at least on OpenBSD and MirBSD), both -lpthread
    and -pthread work but the latter is "preferred", whatever this means.

    Only regard images as pixbufs if they have identity transformations
    
    In order for a src/mask pair to be considered a pixbuf, they have to
    have identical transformations, but we don't check for that. Since the
    only fast paths we have for pixbufs require identity transformations,
    it sufficies to check that both source and mask are
    untransformed.
    
    This is also the reason that this bug can't be triggered by any test
    code - if the source and mask had different transformations, we would
    consider them a pixbuf, but then wouldn't take the fast path because
    at least one of the transformations would be different from the
    identity.

    to four floating point divisions.

    pixman-access.c: Add floating point accessor functions
    
    Three new function pointer fields are added to bits_image_t:
    
          fetch_scanline_float
          fetch_pixel_float
          store_scanline_float
    
    similar to the existing 32 and 64 bit accessors. The fetcher_info_t
    struct in pixman_access similarly gets a new get_scanline_float field.
    
    For most formats, the new get_scanline_float field is set to a new
    function fetch_scanline_generic_float() that first calls the 32 bit
    fetcher uses the 32 bit scanline fetcher and then expands these pixels
    to floating point.
    
    For the 10 bpc formats, new floating point accessors are added that
    use pixman_unorm_to_float() and pixman_float_to_unorm() to convert
    back and forth.
    
    The PIXMAN_a8r8g8b8_sRGB format is handled with a 256-entry table that
    maps 8 bit sRGB channels to linear single precision floating point
    numbers. The sRGB->linear direction can then be done with a simple
    table lookup.
    
    The other direction is currently done with 4096-entry table which
    works fine for 16 bit integers, but not so great for floating
    point. So instead this patch uses a binary search in the sRGB->linear
    table. The existing 32 bit accessors for the sRGB format are also
    converted to use this method.

    Add pixman-combine-float.c
    
    This file contains floating point implementations of combiners for all
    pixman operators. These combiners operate on buffers containing single
    precision floating point pixels stored in (a, r, g, b) order.
    
    The combiners are added to the pixman_implementation_t struct, but
    nothing uses them yet.
    
    This commit incorporates a number of bug fixes contributed by Andrea
    Canciani.
    
    Some notes:
    
    - The combiners are making sure to never divide by zero regardless of
      input, so an application could enable divide-by-zero exceptions and
      pixman wouldn't generate any.
    
    - The operators are implemented according to the Render spec. Ie.,
    
        - If the input pixels are between 0 and 1, then so is the output.
    
        - The source and destination coefficients for the conjoint and
          disjoint operators are clamped to [0, 1].
    
    - The PDF operators are not described in the render spec, and the
      implementation here doesn't do any clamping except in the final
      conversion from floating point to destination format.
    
    All of the above will need to be rethought if we add support for pixel
    formats that can support negative and greater-than-one pixels. It is
    in fact already the case in principle that convolution filters can
    produce pixels with negative values, but since these go through the
    broken "wide" path that narrows everything to 32 bits, these negative
    values don't currently survive to the combiners.

    Add scaled nearest repeat fast paths
    
    Before this patch it was often faster to scale and repeat

    the slow path that the single pass approach takes. This
    makes it so that the single pass approach has competitive
    performance.

    Fix for infinite-loop test
    
    The infinite loop detected by "affine-test 212944861" is caused by an
    overflow in this expression:
    
        max_x = pixman_fixed_to_int (vx + (width - 1) * unit_x) + 1;
    
    where (width - 1) * unit_x doesn't fit in a signed int. This causes
    max_x to be too small so that this:
    
        src_width = 0
    
        while (src_width < REPEAT_NORMAL_MIN_WIDTH && src_width <= max_x)
            src_width += src_image->bits.width;
    
    results in src_width being 0. Later on when src_width is used for
    repeat calculations, we get the infinite loop.
    
    By casting unit_x to int64_t, the expression no longer overflows and
    affine-test 212944861 and infinite-loop no longer loop forever.

    affine-test: Print out the transformation matrix when verbose
    
    Printing out the translation and scale is a bit misleading because the
    actual transformation matrix can be modified in various other ways.
    
    Instead simply print the whole transformation matrix that is actually
    used.

    Fix bugs in component alpha combiners for separable PDF operators
    
    In general, the component alpha version of an operator is supposed to
    do this:
    
           - multiply source with mask in all channels
           - multiply mask with source alpha in all channels
           - compute the regular operator in all channels using the
             mask value whenever source alpha is called for
    
    The first two steps are usually accomplished with the function
    combine_mask_ca(), but for operators where source alpha is not used,
    such as SRC, ADD and OUT, the simpler function
    combine_mask_value_ca(), which doesn't compute the new mask values,
    can be used.
    
    However, the PDF blend modes generally *do* make use of source alpha,
    so they can't use combine_mask_value_ca() as they do now. They have to
    use combine_mask_ca().
    
    This patch fixes this in combine_multiply_ca() and the CA combiners
    generated by PDF_SEPARABLE_BLEND_MODE.

    need to have their alpha channel set to 0xff.

    Make show_image() cope with more formats
    
    This makes show_image() deal with more formats than just a8r8g8b8, in
    particular, a8r8g8b8_sRGB can now be handled.
    
    Images that are passed to show_image with a format of a8r8g8b8_sRGB
    are displayed without modification under the assumption that the
    monitor is approximately sRGB.
    
    Images with a format of a8r8g8b8 are also displayed without
    modification since many other users of show_image() have been
    generating essentially sRGB data with this format. Other formats are
    also assumed to be gamma compressed; these are converted to a8r8g8b8
    before being displayed.
    
    With these changes, srgb-test.c doesn't need to do its own conversion
    anymore.

          In pixman_region32_union_rect: Invalid rectangle passed
          Set a breakpoint on '_pixman_log_error' to debug
    
    when the micro version number of pixman is even.
    
    Fix this by detecting the overflow and clamping such that the x2/y2
    coordinates are less than INT32_MAX.

    Add tests to validate new sRGB behavior
    
    Composite checks random combinations of operations that now also have
    sRGB sources, masks and destinations, and stress-test validates the
    read/write primitives.

    Add sRGB blending demo program
    
    Simple sRGB color blender test can be used to determine if the sRGB processing
    works as expected. It blends alpha ramps of purple and green together such that
    at midpoint of image, 50 % blend of both is realized. At that point, sRGB-aware
    processing yields a result close to #bbb rather than #888, which is the linear
    light blending result.
    
    The demo also contains the sample computation for sRGB premultiplied alpha.

    Add support for sRGB surfaces
    
    sRGB format is defined as a new format type, PIXMAN_TYPE_ARGB_SRGB. One form of
    this type is provided, PIXMAN_a8r8g8b8_sRGB. Use of an sRGB format triggers
    wide processing, and the pixel fetch/store functions handle the relevant
    conversion between color spaces. Pixman itself is thought to compose in the
    linearized sRGB color space.
    
    sRGB conversion is tabularized. For sRGB to linear, we are using only 256
    values because the current source format uses 8 bits per component precision.
    For linear to sRGB, it turns out that only 4096 brightness levels are required
    to generate all of the 256 sRGB color values, and therefore only 12 bits per
    component are considered during store. As a special case, a no-op
    sRGB->linear->sRGB conversion is constructed to be lossless by adjusting the
    sRGB->linear conversion table where necessary.

    Make pixman-mmx.c compile on x86-32 without optimization
    
    When not optimizing, write _mm_shuffle_pi16() as a statement
    expression with inline assembly. That way we avoid
    __builtin_ia32_pshufw(), which is only available when compiling with
    -msse, while still allowing the non-optimizing gcc to understand that
    the second argument is a compile time constant.

    Cleanups and simplifications in x86 CPU feature detection
    
    A new function pixman_cpuid() is added that runs the cpuid instruction
    and returns the results. On GCC this function uses inline assembly; on
    MSVC, the function calls the __cpuid intrinsic.
    
    There is also a new function called have_cpuid() which detects whether
    cpuid is available. On x86-64 and MSVC, it simply returns TRUE; on
    x86-32 bit, it checks whether the 22nd bit of eflags can be
    modified. On MSVC this does have the consequence that pixman will no
    longer work CPUS without cpuid (ie., older than 486 and some 486
    models).
    
    These two functions together makes it possible to write a generic
    detect_cpu_features() in plain C. This function is then used in a new
    have_feature() function that checks whether a specific set of feature
    bits is available.
    
    Aside from the cleanups and simplifications, the main benefit from
    this patch is that pixman now can do feature detection on x86-64, so
    that newer instruction sets such as SSSE3 and SSE4.1 can be used. (And
    apparently the assumption that x86-64 CPUs always have MMX and SSE2 is
    no longer correct: Knight's Corner is x86-64, but doesn't have them).
    
    V2: Rename the constants in the getisax() code, as pointed out by Alan
    Coopersmith. Also reinstate the result variable and initialize
    features to 0.
    
    V3: Fixes for the fact that the upper 32 bits of a 64 bit register are
    zeroed whenever the corresponding 32 bit register is written to.
    
    V4: Fixes for the fact that in 32 bit mode, when gcc is not optimizing
    there were not enough registers available. The new code uses the "a",
    "b", "c", and "d" constraints instead, and has two separate versions
    for 32 and 64 bit modes.

    Declare functions *_inverse() and *_contains_rectangle() in the same
    way as the other functions are declared. This doesn't imply any semantic
    changes. It's just a unification of coding styles.

    Simplify CPU detection on PPC.
    
    Get rid of the initialized and have_vmx static variables in
    pixman-ppc.c There is no point to them since CPU detection only
    happens once per process.
    
    On Linux, just read /proc/self/auxv instead of generating the filename
    with getpid() and don't bother with the stack buffer. Instead just
    read the aux entries one by one.

    Simplifications to ARM CPU detection
    
    Organize pixman-arm.c such that each operating system/compiler exports
    a detect_cpu_features() function that returns a bitmask with the
    various features that we are interested in. A new function
    have_feature() then calls this function, caches the result, and return
    whether the given feature is available.
    
    The result is that all the pixman_have_arm_<feature> functions become
    redundant and can be deleted.

    it directly from _pixman_mips_get_implementations(). Also on
    non-Linux, just make have_feature() return FALSE.

    In fast_composite_tiled_repeat() don't clone images with a palette
    
    In fast_composite_tiled_repeat() if the source image is less than a
    certain constant width, a clone is created which is then
    pre-repeated. However, the source image's palette, if it has one, is
    not cloned, so for indexed images, the pre-repeating would crash.
    
    Fix this by not doing any pre-repeating for images with a palette set.

    test: Make stress-test more likely to actually composite something
    
    stress-test current almost never composites anything because the clip
    rectangles and transformations are such that either
    _pixman_compute_composite_region32() or analyze_extent() will return
    FALSE.
    
    Fix this by:
    
    - making log_rand() return smaller numbers so that the clip rectangles
      are more likely to be within the destination image
    
    - adding rand_x() and rand_y() functions that pick positions within an
      image and using them for positioning alpha maps and source/mask
      positions.
    
    - making it less likely that clip regions are used in general
    
    These changes make the test take longer, so speed it up a little by
    making most images smaller and by reducing the maximum convolution
    filter from 17x19 to 3x4.
    
    With these changes, stress-test reveals a crash in iteration 0xd39
    where fast_composite_tiled_repeat() creates an indexed image without a
    palette.

    Change default bilinear interpolation precision to 7 bits
    
    This improves performance for the current SSE2 code. Further
    reduction to 4 bits may be considered later if it proves
    to allow additional speedup.

    bits-image: Turn all the fetchers into iterator getters
    
    Instead of caching these fetchers in the image structure, and then
    have the iterator getter call them from there, simply change them to
    be iterator getters themselves.
    
    This avoids an extra indirect function call and lets us get rid of the
    get_scanline_32/64 fields in pixman_image_t.

    Faster unorm_to_unorm for wide processing.
    
    Optimizing the unorm_to_unorm functions allows a speedup from:
    
    src_8888_2x10 =  L1:  62.08  L2:  60.73  M: 59.61 (  4.30%)  HT: 46.81
    	VT: 42.17  R: 43.18  RT: 26.01 (325Kops/s)
    
    to:
    
    src_8888_2x10 =  L1:  76.94  L2:  78.43  M: 75.87 (  5.59%)  HT: 56.73
    	VT: 52.39  R: 53.00  RT: 29.29 (363Kops/s)
    
    on a i7 Q720 -based laptop.
    
    The key of the patch is the observation that unorm_to_unorm's work can
    more easily be done with a simple multiplication and shift, when the
    function is applied repeatedly and the parameters are not compile-time
    constants. For instance, converting from 0xfe to 0xfefe (expanding
    from 8 bits to 16 bits) can be done by calculating
    
    c = c * 0x101
    
    However, sometimes the result is not a neat replication of all the
    bits. For instance, going from 10 bits to 16 bits can be done by
    calculating
    
    c = c * 0x401UL >> 4
    
    where the intermediate result is 20 bit wide repetition of the 10-bit
    pattern followed by shifting off the unnecessary lowest bits.
    
    The patch has the algorithm to calculate the factor and the shift, and
    converts the code to use it.

    gcc has no sane way of enabling iwmmxt code generation, like -msse for
    SSE, so you have to use -march=iwmmxt{,2}. User CFLAGS are placed after
    -march=iwmmxt and override the march value, so we have to use a custom
    build rule to order the CFLAGS such that pixman-mmx.c will be built with
    the necessary CFLAGS.

    Speed up _pixman_image_get_solid() in common cases
    
    Make _pixman_image_get_solid() faster by special-casing the common
    cases where the image is SOLID or a repeating a8r8g8b8 image.
    
    This optimization together with the previous one results in a small
    but reproducable performance improvement on the xfce4-terminal-a1

    Speed up _pixman_composite_glyphs_no_mask()
    
    Bypass much of the overhead of pixman_image_composite32() by only
    computing the composite region once instead of once per glyph, and by
    only looking up the composite function whenever the glyph format or
    flags change.
    
    As part of this, the pixman_compute_composite_region32() was renamed
    to _pixman_compute_composite_region32() and exported in
    pixman-private.h.
    
    I couldn't find a trace that would reliably demonstrate that this is
    actually an improvement by itself (since _pixman_composite_glyphs_no_mask()
    is called so rarely), but together with the following optimization for
    solid sources, there is a small but reliable improvement to the
    xfce4-a1-terminal cairo trace.

    Speed up pixman_composite_glyphs()
    
    When adding glyphs to the mask, bypass most of the overhead of
    pixman_image_composite32() by:
    
    - Only looking up the composite function when the glyph changes either
      format or flags.
    
    - Only using a white source when the glyph format is different from
      the mask format.
    
    - Simply intersecting the glyph rectangle with the destination
      rectangle instead of doing the full _pixman_composite_region32().
    
    Performance results:

    Add support for alpha maps to compute_crc32_for_image().
    
    When a destination image I has an alpha map A, the following rules apply:
    
       - If I has an alpha channel itself, the content of that channel is
         undefined
    
       - If A has RGB channels, the content of those channels is
         undefined.
    
    Hence in order to compute the CRC32 for such an image, we have to mask
    off the alpha channel of the image, and the RGB channels of the alpha
    map.
    
    V2: Shifting by 32 is undefined in C

    The pixman_glyph_cache_t is a hash table that maps two keys (a "font"
    and a "glyph" key, but they are just keys; there is no distinction
    between them as far as pixman is concerned) to a glyph. Glyphs in the
    cache can be composited through two new entry points
    pixman_glyph_cache_composite_glyphs() and
    pixman_glyph_cache_composite_glyphs_no_mask().
    
    A glyph cache may only be inserted into when it is "frozen", which is
    achieved by calling pixman_glyph_cache_freeze(). When
    pixman_glyph_cache_thaw() is later called, if the cache has become too
    crowded, some glyphs (currently the least-recently-used) will
    automatically be evicted. This means that a user must ensure that all
    the required glyphs are present in the cache before compositing a
    string. The intended way to use the cache is like this:
    
            pixman_glyph_t glyphs[MAX_GLYPHS];
    
            pixman_glyph_cache_freeze (cache);
    
            for (i = 0; i < n_glyphs; ++i)
            {
                const void *g;
    
                if (!(g = pixman_glyph_cache_lookup (cache, font_key, glyph_key)))
                {
                    img = <rasterize glyph as a pixman_image_t>;
    
                    g = pixman_glyph_cache_insert (cache, font_key, glyph_key,
                                                   glyph_origin_x, glyph_origin_y,
                                                   img);
    
                    if (!g)
                    {
                        /* Clean up out-of-memory condition */
                        goto oom;
                    }
    
                    glyphs[i].pos_x = glyph_x_pos;
                    glyphs[i].pos_y = glyph_y_pos;
                    glyphs[i].glyph = g;
                }
            }
    
            pixman_composite_glyphs (op, src, dest, ..., cache, n_glyphs, glyphs);

    - Move glyphs to front of the MRU list when they are used. Pointed
      out by Behdad Esfahbod.
    - Composite glyphs with (white IN glyph) ADD mask in order to support
      mixed a8 and a8r8g8b8 glyphs. Also pointed out by Behdad.
    - Add pixman_glyph_get_mask_format

    Add doubly linked lists
    
    This commit adds some new inline functions to maintain a doubly linked
    list.
    
    The way to use them is to embed a pixman_link_t into the structures
    that should be linked, and use a pixman_list_t as the head of the
    list.
    
    The new functions are
    
        pixman_list_init (pixman_list_t *list);
        pixman_list_prepend (pixman_list_t *list, pixman_link_t *link);
        pixman_list_move_to_front (pixman_list_t *list, pixman_link_t *link);
    
    There are also a new macro:
    
        CONTAINER_OF(type, member, data);
    
    that can be used to get from a pointer to a member to the containing
    structure.
    
    V2: Use the C89 macro offsetof() instead of rolling our own -
    suggested by Alan Coopersmith.

    Make use of image flags in mmx and sse2 iterators
    
    Now that we have the full image flags available, the SSE2 and MMX
    iterators can simply check against SAMPLES_COVER_CLIP_NEAREST (which
    is computed in pixman_image_composite32()) instead of comparing all
    the x/y/width/height parameters.

    Pass the full image flags to iterators
    
    When pixman_image_composite32() is called some flags are computed that
    indicate various things about the composite operation that can't be
    deduced from the image flags themselves. These additional flags are
    not currently available to iterators. All they can do is read the
    image flags in image->common.flags.
    
    Fix that by passing the info->{src, mask, dest}_flags on to the
    iterator initialization and store the flags in the iter struct as
    "image_flags". At the same time rename the *iterator* flags variable
    to "iter_flags" to avoid confusion.

    test: Composite with solid images instead of using pixman_image_fill_*
    
    There is a couple of places where the test suite uses the
    pixman_image_fill_* functions to initialize images. These functions
    can fail, and will do so if the "fast" implementation is disabled.
    
    So to make sure the test suite passes even using
    PIXMAN_DISABLE="fast", use pixman_image_composite32() with a solid
    image instead of pixman_image_fill_*.

    MIPS: DSPr2: Fix bug in over_n_8888_8888_ca/over_n_8888_0565_ca routines
    
    In main loop (unrolled by factor 2), instead of negating multiplied
    mask values by srca, values of srca was negated, and passed as alpha
    argument for
    
        UN8x4_MUL_UN8x4_ADD_UN8x4 macro.
    
    Instead of:
    
        ma = ~ma;
        UN8x4_MUL_UN8x4_ADD_UN8x4 (d, ma, s);
    
    Code was doing this:
    
        ma = ~srca;
        UN8x4_MUL_UN8x4_ADD_UN8x4 (d, ma, s);
    
    Key is in substituting registers s0/s1 (containing srca value), with
    t0/t1 containing mask values multiplied by srca.  Register usage is
    also improved (less registers are saved on stack, for
    over_n_8888_8888_ca routine).
    
    The bug was introduced in commit d2ee5631 and revealed by composite test.

    If not compiling with -march=iwmmxt, the configure test will still pass,
    thinking that the __builtin_arm_* intrinsic is a function instead of
    generating a single instruction. Since no linking is done, the configure
    test doesn't catch this, and we get linking errors in the build.

    Note that 0.25.4 was a botched release that doesn't have a tag and

    announced, so I'll just use the 0.25.6 version number.

    configure.ac: Rename loongson -> loongson-mmi
    
    Make it match with the other fast paths, and the PIXMAN_DISABLE value is
    already loongson-mmi.

    configure.ac: Fix loongson-mmi out-of-tree builds
    
    When building out-of-tree, gcc wasn't able to find loongson-mmintrin.h
    to compile the test program. Add -I$srcdir to CFLAGS to point gcc to it.

    mmx: add and use pack_4x565 function
    
    The pack_4x565 makes use of the pack_4xpacked565 function which uses pmadd.
    
    Some of the speed up is probably attributable to removing the artificial
    serialization imposed by the
    	vdest = pack_565 (..., vdest, 0);
    	vdest = pack_565 (..., vdest, 1);
    	...
    pattern.

    configure.ac: make -march=loongson2f come before CFLAGS
    
    Otherwise we'd have -march=loongson2f being overridden by automake's
    CFLAGS ordering which causes build failures when -march=<not loongson2f>
    is specified by the user.

    mmx: add src_8888_0565
    
    Uses the pmadd technique described in
    http://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/legacy/mmx/MMX_App_24-16_Bit_Conversion.pdf
    
    The technique uses the packssdw instruction which uses signed
    saturatation. This works in their example because they pack 888 to 555
    leaving the high bit as zero. For packing to 565, it is unsuitable, so
    we replace it with an or+shuffle.

    mmx: Use Loongson pinsrh instruction in pack_565
    
    The pinsrh instruction is analogous to MMX EXT's pinsrw, except like
    other Loongson vector instructions it cannot access the general purpose
    registers. In the cases of other Loongson vector instructions, this is a
    headache, but it is actually a good thing here. Since the instruction is
    different from MMX, I've named the intrinsic loongson_insert_pi16.

    mmx: don't pack and unpack src unnecessarily
    
    The combine function was store8888'ing the result, and all consumers
    were immediately load8888'ing it, causing lots of unnecessary pack and
    unpack instructions.
    
    It's a very straight forward conversion, except for mmx_combine_over_u
    and mmx_combine_saturate_u. mmx_combine_over_u was testing the integer
    result to skip pixels, so we use the is_* functions to test the __m64
    data directly without loading it into an integer register.
    
    For mmx_combine_saturate_u there's not a lot we can do, since it uses
    DIV_UN8.

    mmx: make ldq_u take __m64* directly
    
    Before, if __m64 is allocated in vector or floating-point registers,
    
    	__m64 vs = ldq_u((uint64_t *)src);
    
    would cause src to be loaded into an integer register and then
    transferred to an __m64 register. By switching ldq_u's argument type to
    __m64 we give the compile enough information to recognize that it can
    load to the vector register directly.
    
    This patch is necessary for the Loongson optimizations when __m64 is
    typedef'd as double.

    bits_image_fetch_pixel_convolution(): Make sure channels are signed
    
    In the computation:
    
        srtot += RED_8 (pixel) * f
    
    RED_8 (pixel) is an unsigned quantity, which means the signed filter
    coefficient f gets converted to an unsigned integer before the
    multiplication. We get away with this because when the 32 bit unsigned
    result is converted to int32_t, the correct sign is produced. But if
    srtot had been an int64_t, the result would have been a very large
    positive number.
    
    Fix this by explicitly casting the channels to int.

    We're using a patched gcc-4.5, and having to modify configure.ac and
    autoreconf between changes is annoying. And besides, 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7's
    iwMMXt intrinsic support is equally broken, and we test a known broken
    intrinsic in the configure test program, so the version check is rather
    meaningless.

    Use "=a" and "=d" constraints for rdtsc inline assembly
    
    In 32 bit mode the "=A" constraint refers to the register pair
    edx:eax, but according to GCC developers this is not the case in 64
    bit mode, where it refers to "rax".
    
    Hence, using "=A" for rdtsc is incorrect in 64 bit mode.

    implementations of _mm_shuffle_pi16 and _mm_mulhi_pu16 that is
    currently in the code.

    Just use xmmintrin.h when building with Solaris Studio compilers
    
    Since the Solaris Studio compilers don't have a mode where MMX
    instructions are available and SSE instructions are not, we can
    just use the <xmmintrin.h> header directly.
    
    Fixes build failure due to Studio not supporting the __gnu_inline__
    or __artificial__ attributes.

    Disable implementations mentioned in the PIXMAN_DISABLE environment variable.
    
    With this, it becomes possible to do
    
         PIXMAN_DISABLE="sse2 mmx" some_app
    
    which will run some_app without SSE2 and MMX enabled. This is useful
    for benchmarking, testing and narrowing down bugs.
    
    The current list of implementations that can be disabled:
    
        fast
        mmx
        sse2
        arm-simd
        arm-iwmmxt
        arm-neon
        mips-dspr2
        vmx
    
    The general and noop implementations can't be disabled because pixman
    depends on those being available for correct operation.

    Disable MMX when Clang is being used.
    
    There are several issues with the Clang compiler and pixman-mmx.c:
    
    - When not optimizing, it doesn't seem to recognize that an argument
      to an __always_inline__ function is compile-time constant. This
      results in this error being produced:
    
          fatal error: error in backend: Invalid operand for inline asm
                  constraint 'K'!
    
    - This inline assembly:
    
          asm ("pmulhuw %1, %0\n\t"
              : "+y" (__A)
              : "y" (__B)
          );
    
      results in
    
          fatal error: error in backend: Unsupported asm: input constraint
                  with a matching output constraint of incompatible type!
    
    So disable MMX when the compiler is Clang.

    test: Add a new "pixel_checker_t" object.
    
    Add a new pixel_checker_t object to test/utils.[ch]. This object
    should be initialized with a format and can then be used to check
    whether a given "real" pixel in that format is close enough to a
    "perfect" pixel given as a double precision ARGB struct.
    
    The acceptable deviation is calcuated as follows. Each channel of the
    perfect pixel has 0.004 subtracted from it and is then converted to
    the format. The resulting value is the minimum value that will be
    accepted. Similarly, to compute the maximum value, the channel has
    0.004 added to it and is then converted to the given format. Checking
    a pixel is then a matter of splitting it into channels and checking
    that each is within the computed bounds.
    
    The value of 0.004 was chosen because it is the minimum one that will
    make the existing composite test pass (see next commit). A problem
    with this value is that it causes 0xFE to be acceptable when the
    correct value is 1.0, and 0x01 to be acceptable when the correct value
    is 0. It would be better if, when the result is exactly 0 or exactly
    1, an a8r8g8b8 pixel were required to produce exactly 0x00 or 0xff to
    preserve full black and full white. A deviation value of 0.003 would
    produce this, but currently this would cause tests with operators that
    involve divisions to fail.

    test/alphamap.c: Make dst and orig_dst more independent of each other
    
    When making the copy of the destination, do so separately for the
    image and the alpha map. This ensures that the alpha channel of the
    alpha map will be different from the alpha channel of the actual
    image.
    
    Previously, orig_dst would be copied onto dst along with its alpha
    map, which mean that the alpha map of orig_dst would become the new
    alpha channel of *both* dst and dst's alpha map. This meant that test
    didn't actually test that the alpha maps alpha channel was actually
    fetched.

    The alpha channel from the alpha map must be inserted as the new alpha
    channel when a scanline is fetched from an image. Previously the alpha
    map would overwrite the buffer instead. This wasn't caught be the
    alpha map test because it would only verify that the resulting alpha
    channel was correct, and not pay attention to incorrect color
    channels.

    Reject trapezoids where top (botttom) is above (below) the edges
    
    When a trapezoid has a top/bottom that is above/below the left/right
    edges, degenerate trapezoids become possible. For example the edge
    could be very short and close to horizontal. If the bottom edge is far
    below the bottom point of such a short edge, the result is that the
    lower right corner of the trapezoid will be extremely far to the left.
    
    This kind of trapezoid causes overflows in the rasterization code, so
    change pixman_trapezoid_valid() to reject them.

    Fix a bunch of signed overflow issues
    
    In pixman-fast-path.c: (1 << 31) - 1 causes a signed overflow, so
    change to (1U << n) - 1.
    
    In pixman-image.c: The check for whether m10 == -m01 will overflow
    when -m01 == INT_MIN. Instead just check whether the variables are 1
    and -1.
    
    In pixman-utils.c: When the depth of the topmost channel is 0, we can
    end up shifting by 32.
    
    In blitters-test.c: Replicating the mask would end up shifting more
    than 32.
    
    In region-contains-test.c: Computing the average of two large integers
    could overflow. Instead add half the difference between them to the
    first integer.
    
    In stress-test.c: Masking the value in fake_reader() would sometimes
    shift by 32. Instead just use the most significant bits instead of
    the least significant.

    promoted to int, and the product of two uint8_ts fits in an
    int. However, when comp1_t is uint16, the product does not necessarily
    fit in an int, so casts are necessary.

    gradient-walker: For NONE repeats, when x < 0 or x > 1, set both colors to 0
    
    ec7c9c2b6865b48b8bd14e4 introduced a bug where NONE gradients would be
    misrendered, causing the area outside the gradient to be treated as a
    (very) long fade to transparent.The problem was that a check for
    positions outside the gradients were dropped in favor of relying on
    the sentinels.
    
    Aside from misrendering, this also caused a signed integer overflow
    when the code would compute a stepper size based on MIN_INT32.
    
    This patches fixes the issue by reinstating a check for these cases
    and setting both the right and left colors to transparent black.

    Fix use of uninitialized fields reported by valgrind
    
    In pixman-noop.c and pixman-sse2.c, we are accessing
    image->bits.width/height without first making sure the image is a bits
    image. The warning is harmless because we never act on this
    information without checking that the image is a8r8g8b8, but valgrind
    does warn about it.
    
    In pixman-noop.c, just reorder the clauses in the if statement; in
    pixman-sse2.c require images to have the FAST_PATH_BITS_IMAGE flag
    set.

    ARM: NEON: Bilinear macro template for instruction scheduling
    
    This macro template takes 6 code blocks.
    
    1. process_last_pixel
    2. process_two_pixels
    3. process_four_pixels
    4. process_pixblock_head
    5. process_pixblock_tail
    6. process_pixblock_tail_head
    
    process_last_pixel does not need to update horizontal weight. This
    is done by the template. two and four code block should update
    horizontal weight inside of them. head/tail/tail_head blocks
    consist unrolled core loop. You can apply instruction scheduling
    to the tail_head blocks.
    
    You can also specify size of the pixel block. Supported size is 4
    and 8. If you want to use mask, give BILINEAR_FLAG_USE_MASK flags
    to the template, then you can use register MASK. When using d8~d15
    registers, give BILINEAR_FLAG_USE_ALL_NEON_REGS to make sure
    registers are properly saved on the stack and later restored.

    Use sentinels instead of special casing first and last stops
    
    When storing the gradient stops internally, allocate two more stops,
    one before the beginning of the stop list and one after the
    end. Initialize those stops based on the repeat property of the
    gradient.
    
    This allows gradient_walker_reset() to be simplified because it can
    now simply pick the two closest stops to the position without special
    casing the first and last stops.

    The type of pos in gradient_walker_reset() and gradient_walker_pixel()
    is pixman_fixed_48_16_t and not pixman_fixed_32_32. The types of the
    positions in the walker struct are pixman_fixed_t and not int32_t, and
    need_reset is a boolean, not an integer. The spread field should be
    called repeat and have the type pixman_repeat_t.
    
    Also fix some formatting issues, make gradient_walker_reset() static,
    and delete the pointless PIXMAN_GRADIENT_WALKER_NEED_RESET() macro.

    Simple repeat: Extend too short source scanlines into temporary buffer
    
    Too short scanlines can cause repeat handling overhead and optimized
    pixman composite functions usually process a bunch of pixels in a
    single loop iteration it might be beneficial to pre-extend source
    scanlines. The temporary buffers will usually reside in cache, so
    accessing them should be quite efficient.

    Make sure iwMMXt is only detected on ARM
    
    iwMMXt is incorrectly detected on x86 and amd64. This happens because
    the test uses standard _mm_* intrinsic functions which it compiles with
    -march=iwmmxt, but when the user has set CFLAGS=-march=k8 for instance,
    no error is generated from -march=iwmmxt, even though it's not a valid
    flag on x86/amd64. Passing CFLAGS=-march=native does not override the
    -march=iwmmxt flag though, which is why it wasn't noticed before.
    
    So, just #error out in the test if the __arm__ preprocessor directive
    isn't defined.

    mmx: compile on ARM for iwmmxt optimizations
    
    Check in configure for at least gcc-4.6, since gcc-4.7 (and hopefully
    4.6) will be the eariest version capable of compiling the _mm_*
    intrinsics on ARM/iwmmxt. Even for suitable compile versions I use
    _mm_srli_si64 which is known to cause unpatched compilers to fail.
    
    Select iwmmxt at runtime only after NEON, since we expect the NEON
    optimizations to be more capable and faster than iwmmxt.

    BILINEAR->NEAREST filter optimization for simple rotation and translation
    
    Simple rotation and translation are the additional cases when BILINEAR
    filter can be safely reduced to NEAREST.

    Strength-reduce BILINEAR filter to NEAREST filter for identity transforms
    
    An image with a bilinear filter and an identity transform is
    equivalent to one with a nearest filter, so there is no reason the
    standard fast paths shouldn't be usable.
    
    But because a BILINEAR filter samples a 2x2 pixel block in the source
    image, FAST_PATH_SAMPLES_COVER_CLIP can't be set in the case where the
    source area is the entire image, because some compositing operations
    might then read pixels outside the image.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by splitting the
    FAST_PATH_SAMPLES_COVER_CLIP flag into two separate flags
    FAST_PATH_SAMPLES_COVER_CLIP_NEAREST and
    FAST_PATH_SAMPLES_COVER_CLIP_BILINEAR that indicate that the clip
    covers the samples taking into account NEAREST/BILINEAR filters
    respectively.
    
    All the existing compositing operations that require
    FAST_PATH_SAMPLES_COVER_CLIP then have their flags modified to pick
    either COVER_CLIP_NEAREST or COVER_CLIP_BILINEAR depending on which
    filter they depend on.
    
    In compute_image_info() both COVER_CILP_NEAREST and
    COVER_CLIP_BILINEAR can be set depending on how much room there is
    around the clip rectangle.
    
    Finally, images with an identity transform and a bilinear filter get
    FAST_PATH_NEAREST_FILTER set as well as FAST_PATH_BILINEAR_FILTER.

    test: better coverage for BILINEAR->NEAREST filter optimization
    
    The upcoming optimization which is going to be able to replace BILINEAR filter
    with NEAREST where appropriate needs to analyze the transformation matrix
    and not to make any mistakes.
    
    The changes to affine-test include:
    1. Higher chance of using the same scale factor for x and y axes. This can help
       to stress some special cases (for example the case when both x and y scale
       factors are integer). The same applies to x/y translation.
    2. Introduced a small chance for "corrupting" transformation matrix by flipping
       random bits. This supposedly can help to identify the cases when some of the
       fast paths or other code logic is wrongly activated due to insufficient checks.

    Eliminate compute_sample_extents() function
    
    In analyze_extents(), instead of calling compute_sample_extents() call
    compute_transformed_extents() and inline the remaining part of
    compute_sample_extents(). The upcoming bilinear->nearest optimization
    will do something different with these two pieces of code.

    compute_sample_extents() have two parts: one that computes the
    transformed extents, and one that checks whether the computed extents
    fit within the 16.16 coordinate space.
    
    Split the first part into its own function
    compute_transformed_extents().

    Remove x and y coordinates from analyze_extents() and compute_sample_extents()
    
    These coordinates were only ever used for subtracting from the extents
    box to put it into the coordinate space of the image, so we might as
    well do this coordinate translation only once before entering the
    functions.

    which is a simple composition of a single pixel wide image. Sadly this
    is a workaround for lack of independent repeat-x/y handling in cairo and
    pixman. Worse still is that the worst-case behaviour of the general repeat
    path is for width 1 images...

    Workaround bug in llvm-gcc
    
    llvm-gcc (shipped in Apple XCode 4.1.1 as the default compiler or in
    the 2.9 release of LLVM) performs an invalid optimization which
    unifies the empty_region and the bad_region structures because they
    have the same content.
    
    A bugreport has been filed against Apple Developers Tool for this
    issue. This commit works around this bug by making one of the two
    structures volatile, so that it cannot be merged.
    
    Fixes region-contains-test.

    In pixman_image_create_bits() allow images larger than 2GB
    
    There is no reason for pixman_image_create_bits() to check that the
    image size fits in int32_t. The correct check is against size_t since
    that is what the argument to calloc() is.
    
    This patch fixes this by adding a new _pixman_multiply_overflows_size()
    and using it in create_bits(). Also prepend an underscore to the names
    of other similar functions since they are internal to pixman.
    
    V2: Use int, not ssize_t for the arguments in create_bits() since
    width/height are still limited to 32 bits, as pointed out by Chris
    Wilson.

    Speed up pixman_region{,32}_contains_rectangle()
    
    When someone selects some text in Firefox under a non-composited X
    server and initiates a drag, a shaped window is created with a complex
    shape corresponding to the outline of the text. Then, on every mouse
    movement pixman_region_contains_rectangle() is called many times on
    that complicated region. And pixman_region_contains_rectangle() is
    doing a linear scan through the rectangles in the region, although the
    scan does exit when it finds the first box that can't possibly
    intersect the passed-in rectangle.
    
    This patch changes the loop so that it uses a binary search to skip
    boxes that don't overlap the current y position.  The performance
    improvement for the text dragging case is easily noticable.
    
    V2: Use the binary search for the "getting up to speed or skippping
    remainder of band" as well.

    Fix lcg_rand_u32() to return 32 random bits.
    
    The lcg_rand() function only returns 15 random bits, so lcg_rand_u32()
    would always have 0 in bit 31 and bit 15. Fix that by calling
    lcg_rand() three times, to generate 15, 15, and 2 random bits
    respectively.
    
    V2: Use the 10/11 most significant bits from the 3 lcg results and mix
    them with the low ones from the adjacent one, as suggested by Andrea
    Canciani.

    Bilinear REPEAT_NORMAL source line extension for too short src_width
    
    To avoid function call and other calculation overhead, extend source
    scanline into temporary buffer when source width is too small.
    Temporary buffer will be repeatedly accessed, so extension cost is
    very small due to cache effect.

    REPEAT_NORMAL support for bilinear fast path template
    
    The basic idea is to break down normal repeat into a set of
    non-repeat scanline compositions and stitching them together.
    
    Bilinear may interpolate last and first pixels of source scanline.
    In this case, we can use temporary wrap around buffer.

    Replace boolean arguments with flags for bilinear fast path template
    
    By replacing boolean arguments with flags, the code can be more
    readable and flags can be extended to do some more things later.
    
    Currently following flags are defined.
    
    FLAG_NONE
        - No flags are turned on.
    
    FLAG_HAVE_SOLID_MASK
        - Template will generate solid mask composite functions.
    
    FLAG_HAVE_NON_SOLID_MASK
        - Template will generate bits mask composite functions.
    
    FLAG_HAVE_SOLID_MASK and FLAG_NON_SOLID_MASK should be mutually
    exclusive.

    ARM: Fix two bugs in neon_composite_over_n_8888_0565_ca().
    
    The first bug is that a vmull.u8 instruction would store its result in
    the q1 register, clobbering the d2 register used later on. The second
    is that a vraddhn instruction would overwrite d25, corrupting the q12
    register used later.
    
    Fixing the second bug caused a pipeline bubble where the d18 register
    would be unavailable for a clock cycle. This is fixed by swapping the
    instruction with its successor.

    Move noop dest fetching to noop implementation
    
    It will at some point become useful to have CPU specific destination
    iterators. However, a problem with that, is that such iterators should
    not be used if we can composite directly in the destination image.
    
    By moving the noop destination iterator to the noop implementation, we
    can ensure that it will be chosen before any CPU specific iterator.

    Add a noop composite function for the DST operator
    
    The DST operator doesn't actually do anything, so add a noop "fast
    path" for it, instead of checking in pixman_image_composite32().
    
    The performance tradeoff here is that we get rid of a test for DST in
    the common case where the operator is not DST, in return for an extra
    walk over the clip rectangles in the uncommon case where the operator
    actually is DST.

    Add a "noop" implementation.
    
    This new implementation is ahead of all other implementations in the
    fallback chain and is supposed to contain operations that are "noops",
    ie., they don't require any work. For example, it might contain a
    "fast path" for the DST operator that doesn't actually do anything or
    an iterator for a8r8g8b8 that just returns a pointer into the image.

    ARM: NEON scanline functions for bilinear scaling
    
    General fetch->combine->store based bilinear scanline functions.
    Need further optimizations and eventually will be replaced with optimal
    functions one by one.
    General functions should be located in pixman-arm-neon-asm-bilinear.S and
    optimal functions in pixman-arm-neon-asm.S

    Offset rendering in pixman_composite_trapezoids() by (x_dst, y_dst)
    
    Previously, this function would do coordinate calculations in such a
    way that (x_dst, y_dst) would only affect the alignment of the source
    image, but not of the traps, which would always be considered to be in
    absolute destination coordinates. This is unlike the
    pixman_image_composite() function which also registers the mask to the
    destination.
    
    This patch makes it so that traps are also offset by (x_dst, y_dst).
    
    Also add a comment explaining how this function is supposed to
    operate, and update tri-test.c and composite-trap-test.c to deal with
    the new semantics.

    Fix OpenMP not supported case
    
    PIXMAN_LINK_WITH_ENV did not fail unless -Wall -Werror is used.
    So even when the compiler did not support OpenMP, USE_OPENMP was defined.
    Fix that by running the second OpenMP test only when first AC_OPENMP find supported
    
    configure tested in the cases :
    gcc without libgomp support, no openmp option, --enable-openmp and --disable-openmp
    gcc with libgomp support, no openmp option, --enable-openmp and --disable-openmp
    
    Not tested with autoconf version not knowing openmp (<2.62)

    Add simple support for the r8g8b8a8 and r8g8b8x8 formats.
    
    This format is particularly useful on big-endian architectures, where RGBA in
    memory/file order corresponds to r8g8b8a8 as an uint32_t. This is important
    because RGBA is in some cases the only available choice (for example as a pixel
    format in OpenGL ES 2.0).

    This patch makes so that composite and stress-test will start from a
    random seed if the PIXMAN_RANDOMIZE_TESTS environment variable is
    set. Running the test suite in this mode is useful to get more test
    coverage.
    
    Also, in stress-test.c make it so that setting the initial seed causes
    threads to be turned off. This makes it much easier to see when
    something fails.

    ARM: common macro for nearest scaling fast paths
    
    The code of nearest scaled 'src_0565_0565' function was generalized
    and moved to a common macro, so that it can be reused for other
    fast paths.

    SSE2 optimization for bilinear scaled 'src_8888_8888'
    
    A primitive naive implementation of bilinear scaling using SSE2 intrinsics,
    which only handles one pixel at a time. It is approximately 2x faster than
    pixman general compositing path. Single pass processing without intermediate
    temporary buffer contributes to ~15% and loop unrolling contributes to ~20%
    of this speedup.

    Main loop template for fast single pass bilinear scaling
    
    Can be used for implementing SIMD optimized fast path
    functions which work with bilinear scaled source images.
    
    Similar to the template for nearest scaling main loop, the
    following types of mask are supported:
    1. no mask
    2. non-scaled a8 mask with SAMPLES_COVER_CLIP flag
    3. solid mask
    
    PAD repeat is fully supported. NONE repeat is partially
    supported (right now only works if source image has alpha
    channel or when alpha channel of the source image does not
    have any effect on the compositing operation).

    Ensure that tests run as the last step of a build for 'make check'
    
    Previously 'make check' would compile and run tests first, and only
    then proceed to compiling demos. Which is not very convenient
    because of the need to scroll back console output to see the
    tests verdict. Swapping order of SUBDIRS variable entries in
    Makefile.am resolves this.

    Better support for NONE repeat in nearest scaling main loop template
    
    Scaling function now gets an extra boolean argument, which is set
    to TRUE when we are fetching padding pixels for NONE repeat. This
    allows to make a decision whether to interpret alpha as 0xFF or 0x00
    for such pixels when working with formats which don't have alpha
    channel (for example x8r8g8b8 and r5g6b5).

    Support for a8 and solid mask in nearest scaling main loop template
    
    In addition to the most common case of not having any mask at all, two
    variants of scaling with mask show up in cairo traces:
    1. non-scaled a8 mask with SAMPLES_COVER_CLIP flag
    2. solid mask
    
    This patch extends the nearest scaling main loop template to also
    support these cases.

    C fast paths for a simple 90/270 degrees rotation
    
    Depending on CPU architecture, performance is in the range of 1.5 to 4 times
    slower than simple nonrotated copy (which would be an ideal case, perfectly
    utilizing memory bandwidth), but still is more than 7 times faster if
    compared to general path.
    
    This implementation sets a performance baseline for rotation. The use
    of SIMD instructions may further improve memory bandwidth utilization.

    Move fallback decisions from implementations into pixman-cpu.c.
    
    Instead of having each individual implementation decide which fallback
    to use, move it into pixman-cpu.c, where a more global decision can be
    made.
    
    This is accomplished by adding a "fallback" argument to all the
    pixman_implementation_create_*() implementations, and then in
    _pixman_choose_implementation() pass in the desired fallback.

    Fix destination fetching
    
    When fetching from destinations, we need to ignore transformations,
    repeat and filtering. Currently we don't ignore them, which means all
    kinds of bad things can happen.
    
    This bug fixes this problem by directly calling the scanline fetchers
    for destinations instead of going through the full
    get_scanline_32/64().

    At this point these functions are basically a cache that the bits
    image uses for its fetchers, so they can be moved to the bits image.
    
    With the scanline getters only being initialized in the bits image,
    the _pixman_image_get_scanline_generic_64 can be moved to
    pixman-bits-image.c. That gets rid of the final user of
    _pixman_image_get_scanline_32/64, so these can be deleted.

    Add iterators in the general implementation
    
    We add a new structure called a pixman_iter_t that encapsulates the
    information required to read scanlines from an image. It contains two
    functions, get_scanline() and write_back(). The get_scanline()
    function will generate pixels for the current scanline. For iterators
    for source images, it will also advance to the next scanline. The
    write_back() function is only called for destination images. Its
    function is to write back the modified pixels to the image and then
    advance to the next scanline.
    
    When an iterator is initialized, it is passed this information:
    
       - The image to iterate
    
       - The rectangle to be iterated
    
       - A buffer that the iterator may (but is not required to) use. This
         buffer is guaranteed to have space for at least width pixels.
    
       - A flag indicating whether a8r8g8b8 or a16r16g16b16 pixels should
         be fetched
    
    There are a number of (eventual) benefits to the iterators:
    
       - The initialization of the iterator can be virtualized such that
         implementations can plug in their own CPU specific get_scanline()
         and write_back() functions.
    
       - If an image is horizontal, it can simply plug in an appropriate
         get_scanline(). This way we can get rid of the annoying
         classify() virtual function.
    
       - In general, iterators can remember what they did on the last
         scanline, so for example a REPEAT_NONE image might reuse the same
         data for all the empty scanlines generated by the zero-extension.
    
       - More detailed information can be passed to iterator, allowing
         more specialized fetchers to be used.
    
       - We can fix the bug where destination filters and transformations
         are not currently being ignored as they should be.
    
    However, this initial implementation is not optimized at all. We lose
    several existing optimizations:
    
       - The ability to composite directly in the destination
       - The ability to only fetch one scanline for horizontal images
       - The ability to avoid fetching the src and mask for the CLEAR
         operator
    
    Later patches will re-introduce these optimizations.

    Make 'fast_composite_scaled_nearest_*' less suspicious
    
    Taking address of a variable and then using it as an array looks suspicious
    to static code analyzers. So change it into an array with 1 element to make
    them happy. Both old and new variants of this code are correct because 'vx'
    and 'unit_x' arguments are set to 0 and it means that the called scanline
    function can only access a single element of 'zero' buffer.

    Fix linking issues when HAVE_FEENABLEEXCEPT is set.
    
    All objects using test/util.c fail to link:
    |   CCLD   region-test
    | /usr/bin/ld: utils.o: in function enable_fp_exceptions:utils.c(.text+0x939): error: undefined reference to 'feenableexcept'
    
    There's indeed no explicit dependency on -lm, and if HAVE_FEENABLEEXCEPT
    happens to be set, test/util.c uses feenableexcept(), which is nowhere
    to be found while linking.
    
    Fix this by adding -lm to TEST_LDADD, although two alternatives could be
    thought of:
     - Only specifying -lm for objects using util.c.
     - Introducing a conditional to add -lm only when configure detects
       have_feenableexcept=yes.

    Fix for potential unaligned memory accesses
    
    The temporary scanline buffer allocated on stack was declared
    as uint8_t array. As a result, the compiler was free to select
    any arbitrary alignment for it (even though there is typically
    no reason to use really weird alignments here and the stack is
    normally at least 4 bytes aligned on most platforms). Having
    improper alignment is non-portable and can impact performance
    or even make the code misbehave depending on the target platform.
    
    Using uint64_t type for this array should ensure that any possible
    memory accesses done by pixman code are going to be handled correctly
    (pixman-combine64.c can access this buffer via uint64_t * pointer).
    
    Some alignment related problem was reported in:

    ARM: reuse common NEON code for over_{n_8|8888_n|8888_8}_0565
    
    Renamed suppementary macros from 'over_n_8_0565' to 'over_8888_8_0565',
    because they can actually support all variants of this operation:
    over_8888_8_0565/over_n_8_0565/over_8888_n_0565.
    
    Also 'over_8888_8_0565' now uses more optimized common code instead of its
    own variant, improving performance a bit. Even though this operation is
    still memory bandwidth limited, scaled variants of these fast paths may
    put more stress on CPU later.

    ARM: better NEON instructions scheduling for over_n_8_0565
    
    Code rearranged to get better instructions scheduling for ARM Cortex-A8/A9.
    Now it is ~30% faster for the pixel data in L1 cache and makes better use
    of memory bandwidth when running at lower clock frequencies (ex. 500MHz).
    Also register d24 (pixels from the mask image) is now not clobbered by
    supplementary macros, which allows to reuse them for the other variants
    of compositing operations later.

    This macro hides the implementation details of pixels fetching
    for the mask image just like 'fetch_src_pixblock' does for the
    source image. This provides more possibilities for reusing the
    same code blocks in different compositing functions.
    
    This patch does not introduce any functional changes and the
    resulting code in the compiled object file is exactly the same.

    Fix opacity check
    
    Radial gradients are "conical", thus they can have some non-opaque
    parts even if all of their stops are completely opaque.
    
    To guarantee that a radial gradient is actually opaque, it needs to
    also have one of the two circles containing the other one. In this
    case when extrapolating, the whole plane is completely covered (as
    explained in the comment in pixman-radial-gradient.c).

    ARM: optimization for scaled src_0565_0565 with nearest filter
    
    The performance improvement is only in the ballpark of 5% when
    compared against C code built with a reasonably good compiler
    (gcc 4.5.1). But gcc 4.4 produces approximately 30% slower code
    here, so assembly optimization makes sense to avoid dependency
    on the compiler quality and/or optimization options.

    ARM: nearest scaling support for NEON scanline compositing functions
    
    Now it is possible to generate scanline processing functions
    for the case when the source image is scaled with NEAREST filter.
    
    Only 16bpp and 32bpp pixel formats are supported for now. But the
    others can be also added later when needed. All the existing NEON
    fast path functions should be quite easy to reuse for implementing
    fast paths which can work with scaled source images.

    ARM: NEON: source image pixel fetcher can be overrided now
    
    Added a special macro 'pixld_src' which is now responsible for fetching
    pixels from the source image. Right now it just passes all its arguments
    directly to 'pixld' macro, but it can be used in the future to provide
    a special pixel fetcher for implementing nearest scaling.
    
    The 'pixld_src' has a lot of arguments which define its behavior. But
    for each particular fast path implementation, we already know NEON
    registers allocation and how many pixels are processed in a single block.
    That's why a higher level macro 'fetch_src_pixblock' is also introduced
    (it's easier to use because it has no arguments) and used everywhere
    in 'pixman-arm-neon-asm.S' instead of VLD instructions.
    
    This patch does not introduce any functional changes and the resulting code
    in the compiled object file is exactly the same.

    Do CPU features detection from 'constructor' function when compiled with gcc
    
    There is attribute 'constructor' supported since gcc 2.7 which allows
    to have a constructor function for library initialization. This eliminates
    an extra branch for each composite operation and also helps to avoid
    complains from race condition detection tools like helgrind.
    
    The other compilers may or may not support this attribute properly.
    Ideally, the compilers should fail to compile the code with unknown
    attribute, so the configure check should do the right job. But in
    reality the problems are surely possible. Fortunately such problems
    should be quite easy to find because NULL pointer dereference should
    happen almost immediately if the constructor fails to run.
    
    clang 2.7:
      supports __attribute__((constructor)) properly and pretends to be gcc
    
    tcc 0.9.25:
      ignores __attribute__((constructor)), but does not pretend to be gcc

    [mmx] Mark some of the output variables as early-clobber.
    
    GCC assumes that input variables in inline assembly are fully consumed
    before any output variable is written. This means it may allocate the
    variables in the same register unless the output variables are marked
    as early-clobber.
    
    From Jeremy Huddleston:
    
        I noticed a problem building pixman with clang and reported it to
        the clang developers.  They responded back with a comment about
        the inline asm in pixman-mmx.c and suggested a fix:
    
        """
        Incidentally, Jeremy, in the asm that reads
        __asm__ (
        "movq %7, %0\n"
        "movq %7, %1\n"
        "movq %7, %2\n"

        : "y" (vfill));
    
        all the output operands except the last one should be marked as

    Remove workaround for a bug in the 1.6 X server.
    
    There used to be a bug in the X server where it would rely on
    out-of-bounds accesses when it was asked to composite with a
    window as the source. It would create a pixman image pointing
    to some bogus position in memory, but then set a clip region
    to the position where the actual bits were.
    
    Due to a bug in old versions of pixman, where it would not clip
    against the image bounds when a clip region was set, this would
    actually work. So when the pixman bug was fixed, a workaround was
    added to allow certain out-of-bound accesses.
    
    However, the 1.6 X server is so old now that we can remove this
    workaround. This does mean that if you update pixman to 0.22 or later,
    you will need to use a 1.7 X server or later.

    ARM: restore fallback to ARMv6 implementation from NEON in the delegate chain
    
    After fast path cache introduction, the overhead of having this fallback is
    insignificant. On the other hand, some of the ARM assembly optimizations (for
    example nearest neighbor scaling) do not need NEON.

    These minor changes should fix a large number of
    macro declaration - related "syntax error:  empty declaration" warnings
    which are seen while compiling the code with the Solaris Studio
    compiler.

    Delete simple repeat code
    
    This was supposedly an optimization, but it has pathological cases
    where it definitely isn't. For example a 1 x n image will cause it to
    have terrible memory access patterns and to generate a ton of modulus
    operations.
    
    Since no one has ever measured whether it actually is an improvement,
    and since it is doing the repeating at the wrong the stage in the
    pipeline, and since with the previous commit it can't be triggered
    anymore because we now require SAMPLES_COVER_CLIP for regular fast
    paths, just delete it.

    Fix bug in FAST_PATH_STD_FAST_PATH
    
    The standard fast paths deal with two kinds of images: solids and
    bits. These two image types require different flags, but
    PIXMAN_STD_FAST_PATH uses the same ones for both.
    
    This patch makes it so that solid images just get the standard flags,
    while bits images must be untransformed contain the destination clip
    within the sample grid.
    
    This means that the old FAST_PATH_COVERS_CLIP flag is now not used
    anymore, so it can be deleted.

    Some clean-ups in fence_malloc() and fence_free()
    
    This patch removes an unnecessary typecast of MAP_FAILED,
    replaces an erroneous free() by the correct munmap() in the
    error path for a failing mprotect(), and, finally, removes
    redundant calls to mprotect() that aren't necessary, because
    munmap() doesn't call for any specific memory protection.

    compute_composite_region32: Zero extents before returning FALSE.
    
    If the extents of the composite region are broken such that x2 <= x1
    or y2 <= y1, then we need to zero the extents before returning so that
    the region won't be completely broken when calling
    pixman_region32_fini().

    Add a lowlevel blitter benchmark
    
    This test is a modified version of Siarhei's compositor throughput
    benchmark.  It's expanded with explicit reporting of memory bandwidth
    consumption for the M-test, and with an additional 8x8-random test
    intended to determine peak ops/sec capability.  There are also quite a
    lot more operations tested for.

    the POSIX gettimeofday() function when available, and fall back to
    clock() when not.

    Use a macro to generate some {a,x}8r8g8b8, a8, and r5g6b5 bilinear fetchers.
    
    There are versions for all combinations of x8r8g8b8/a8r8g8b8 and
    pad/repeat/none/normal repeat modes. The bulk of each scaler is an
    inline function that takes a format and a repeat mode as parameters.
    
    The new scalers are all commented out, but the next commits will
    enable them one at a time to facilitate bisecting.

    test: Add affine-test
    
    This test tests compositing with various affine transformations. It is
    almost identical to scaling-test, except that it also applies a random
    rotation in addition to the random scaling and translation.

    analyze_extents: Fast path for non-transformed BITS images
    
    Profiling various cairo traces showed that we were spending a lot of
    time in analyze_extents and compute_sample_extents(). This was
    especially bad for glyphs where all this computation was completely
    unnecessary.
    
    This patch adds a fast path for the case of non-transformed BITS
    images. The result is approximately a 6% improvement on the
    firefox-talos-gfx benchmark:
    
    Before:
    
    [ # ]  backend                         test   min(s) median(s) stddev. count
    [  0]    image            firefox-talos-gfx   13.797   13.848   0.20%    6/6
    
    After:
    
    [ # ]  backend                         test   min(s) median(s) stddev. count
    [  0]    image            firefox-talos-gfx   12.946   13.018   0.39%    6/6

    Move some of the FAST_PATH_COVERS_CLIP computation to pixman-image.c
    
    When an image is solid or repeating, the FAST_PATH_COVERS_CLIP flag
    can be set in compute_image_info().
    
    Also the code that turned this flag off in pixman.c was not correct;
    it didn't take transformations into account. With this patch, pixman.c
    doesn't set the flag by default, but instead relies on the call to
    compute_samples_extents() to set it when possible.

    By the way, it seems that with gcc 4.5.0 from mingw.org, __thread, sse
    and mmx work fine.
    
    I added the below to pixman 0.18 and as far as I can see, it works.
    make check reports no problems. (Earlier I had to use --disable-mmx
    and --disable-sse2.) Also gtk-demo and gimp run fine.
    
    (Also a change to get rid of the warnings about -fvisibility being ignored.)

    Remove FAST_PATH_NARROW_FORMAT flag if there is a wide alpha map
    
    If an image has an alpha map that has wide components, then we need to
    use 64 bit processing for that image. We detect this situation in
    pixman-image.c and remove the FAST_PATH_NARROW_FORMAT flag.
    
    In pixman-general, the wide/narrow decision is now based on the flags
    instead of on the formats.

    Rename FAST_PATH_NO_WIDE_FORMAT to FAST_PATH_NARROW_FORMAT
    
    This avoids a negative in the name. Also, by renaming the "wide"
    variable in pixman-general.c to "narrow" and fixing up the logic
    correspondingly, the code there reads a lot more straightforwardly.

    Add fence_malloc() and fence_free().
    
    These variants of malloc() and free() try to surround the allocated
    memory with protected pages so that out-of-bounds accessess will cause
    a segmentation fault.
    
    If mprotect() and getpagesize() are not available, these functions are
    simply equivalent to malloc() and free().

    SSE2 optimization for scaled over_8888_8888 operation with nearest filter
    
    This is the first demo implementation, it should be possible to
    generalize it later to cover more operations with less lines of code.
    
    It should be also possible to introduce the use of '__builtin_constant_p'
    gcc builtin function for an efficient way of checking if 'unit_x' is known
    to be zero at compile time (when processing padding pixels for NONE, or
    PAD repeat).
    
    Benchmarks from Intel Core i7 860:
    
    == before (nearest OVER) ==
    op=3, src_fmt=20028888, dst_fmt=20028888, speed=142.01 MPix/s

    NONE repeat support for fast scaling with nearest filter
    
    Implemented very similar to PAD repeat.
    
    And gcc also seems to be able to completely eliminate the
    code responsible for left and right padding pixels for OVER
    operation with NONE repeat.

    PAD repeat support for fast scaling with nearest filter
    
    When processing pixels from the left and right padding, the same
    scanline function is used with 'unit_x' set to 0.
    
    Actually appears that gcc can handle this quite efficiently. When
    using 'restrict' keyword, it is able to optimize the whole operation
    performed on left or right padding pixels to a small unrolled loop
    (the code is reduced to a simple fill implementation):
    
        9b30:       89 08                   mov    %ecx,(%rax)
        9b32:       89 48 04                mov    %ecx,0x4(%rax)
        9b35:       48 83 c0 08             add    $0x8,%rax
        9b39:       49 39 c0                cmp    %rax,%r8
        9b3c:       75 f2                   jne    9b30
    
    Without 'restrict' keyword, there is one instruction more: reloading
    source pixel data from memory in the beginning of each iteration. That
    is slower, but also acceptable.

    We need to implement a true PIXMAN_REPEAT_NONE support later (padding
    the source with zero pixels). So it's better not to use PIXMAN_REPEAT_NONE
    for handling FAST_PATH_SAMPLES_COVER_CLIP special case.

    Nearest scaling fast path macro split into two parts
    
    Scanline processing is now split into a separate function. This provides
    an easy way of overriding it with a platform specific implementation,
    which may use SIMD optimizations. Only basic C data types are used as
    the arguments for this function, so it may be implemented entirely in
    assembly or be generated by some JIT engine.
    
    Also as a result of this split, the complexity of code is reduced a
    bit and now it should be easier to introduce support for the currently
    missing NONE, PAD and REFLECT repeat types.

    When pixman_compute_composite_region32() returns FALSE, don't fini the region.
    
    The rule is that the region passed in must be initialized and that the
    region returned will still be valid. Ie., the lifecycle is the
    responsibility of the caller, regardless of what the function returns.
    
    Previously, compute_composite_region32() would finalize the region and
    then return FALSE, and then the caller would finalize the region
    again, leading to memory corruption in some cases.

    Use windows.h directly for mingw32 build
    
    This patch adresses the issue discussed in
    http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/pixman/2010-April/000163.html
    
    There were only two clashing identifiers.  The first one is IN, which
    obviously causes problems in Pixman for lines like
    
        PIXMAN_STD_FAST_PATH (IN, solid, a8, a8, fast_composite_in_n_8_8),
    
    Fortunately the mingw headers provide a solution: by defining
    _NO_W32_PSEUDO_MODIFIERS, these stupid symbols are skipped.
    
    The other name is UINT64, used in pixman-mmx.c. I renamed that
    function to to_uint64, but may be another name is more appropriate.

    Be more paranoid about checking for GTK+
    
    From time to time people run into issues where the configure script
    detects GTK+ when it is either not installed, or not functional due to
    a missing pixman. Most recently:
    
      https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=29736
    
    This patch makes the configure script more paranoid by
    
    - always using PKG_CHECK_MODULES and not PKG_CHECK_EXISTS, since it
    seems PKG_CHECK_EXISTS will sometimes return true even if a dependency
    of GTK+, such as pixman-1, is missing.
    
    - explicitly checking that pixman-1 is installed before enabling GTK+.

    Fixes the region-translate test case by clipping region translations to

    Only try to compute the FAST_SAMPLES_COVER_CLIP for bits images
    
    It doesn't make sense in other cases, and the computation would make

    accesses when the image wasn't of type BITS.

    Introduce new FAST_PATH_SAMPLES_OPAQUE flag
    
    This flag is set whenever the pixels of a bits image don't have an

    that the image effectively is opaque, so we can do operator reductions
    such as OVER->SRC.

    Store the various bits image fetchers in a table with formats and flags.
    
    Similarly to how the fast paths are done, put the various bits_image
    fetchers in a table, so that we can quickly find the best one based on
    the image's flags and format.

    Add some new FAST_PATH flags
    
    The flags are:
    
     *  AFFINE_TRANSFORM, for affine transforms
    
     *  Y_UNIT_ZERO, for when the 10 entry in the transformation is zero
    
     *  FILTER_BILINEAR, for when the image has a bilinear filter
    
     *  NO_NORMAL_REPEAT, for when the repeat mode is not NORMAL
    
     *  HAS_TRANSFORM, for when the transform is not NULL
    
    Also add some new FAST_PATH_REPEAT_* macros. These are just shorthands
    for the image not having any of the other repeat modes. For example
    REPEAT_NORMAL is (NO_NONE | NO_PAD | NO_REFLECT).

    These functions can simply be passed as arguments to the various pixel
    fetchers. We don't need to store them. Since they are known at compile
    time and the pixel fetchers are force_inline, this is not a
    performance issue.
    
    Also temporarily make all pixel access go through the alpha path.

    Replace compute_src_extent_flags() with analyze_extents()
    
    This commit fixes two separate problems: 1. Incorrect computation of
    the FAST_PATH_SAMPLES_COVER_CLIP flag, and 2. FAST_PATH_16BIT_SAFE is
    a nonsensical thing to compute.
    
    == 1. Incorrect computation of SAMPLES_COVER_CLIP:
    
    Previously we were using pixman_transform_bounds() to compute which
    source samples would be used for a composite operation. This is
    incorrect for several reasons:
    
    (a) pixman_transform_bounds() is transforming the integer bounding box
    of the destination samples, where it should be transforming the
    bounding box of the samples themselves. In other words, it is too
    pessimistic in some cases.
    
    (b) pixman_transform_bounds() is not rounding the same way as we do
    during sampling. For example, for a NEAREST filter we subtract
    pixman_fixed_e before rounding off to the nearest sample so that a
    transformed value of 1 will round to the sample at 0.5 and not to the
    one at 1.5. However, pixman_transform_bounds() would simply truncate
    to 1 which would imply that the first sample to be used was the one at
    1.5. In other words, it is too optimistic in some cases.
    
    (c) The result of pixman_transform_bounds() does not account for the
    interpolation filter applied to the source.
    
    == 2. FAST_PATH_16BIT_SAFE is nonsensical
    
    The FAST_PATH_16BIT_SAFE is a flag that indicates that various
    computations can be safely done within a 16.16 fixed-point
    variable. It was used by certain fast paths who relied on those
    computations succeeding. The problem is that many other compositing
    functions were making similar assumptions but not actually requiring
    the flag to be set. Notably, all the general compositing functions
    simply walk the source region using 16.16 variables. If the
    transformation happens to overflow, strange things will happen.
    
    So instead of computing this flag in certain cases, it is better to
    simply detect that overflows will happen and not try to composite at
    all in that case. This has the advantage that most compositing
    functions can be written naturally way.
    
    It does have the disadvantage that we are giving up on some cases that
    previously worked, but those are all corner cases where the areas
    involved were very close to the limits of the coordinate
    system. Relying on these working reliably was always a somewhat
    dubious proposition. The most important case that might have worked
    previously was untransformed compositing involving images larger than
    32 bits. But even in those cases, if you had REPEAT_PAD or
    REPEAT_REFLECT turned on, you would hit bits_image_fetch_transformed()
    which has the 16 bit limitations.
    
    == Fixes
    
    This patch fixes both problems by introducing a new function called
    analyze_extents() that has the responsibility to reject corner cases,
    and to compute flags based on the extents.
    
    It does this through a new compute_sample_extents() function that will
    compute a conservative (but tight) approximation to the bounding box
    of the samples that will actually be needed. By basing the computation
    on the positions of the _sample_ locations in the destination, and by
    taking the interpolation filter into account, it fixes problem one.
    
    The same function is also used with a one-pixel expanded version of
    the destination extents. By checking if the transformed bounding box
    will overflow 16.16 fixed point, it fixes problem two.

    Extend scaling-crash-test in various ways
    
    This extends scaling-crash-test to test some more things:
    
    - All combinations of NEAREST/BILINEAR/CONVOLUTION filters and
      NORMAL/PAD/REFLECT repeat modes.
    
    - Tests various scale factors very close to 1/7th such that the source
      area is very close to edge of the source image.
    
    - The same things, only with scale factors very close to 1/32767th.
    
    - Enables the commented-out tests for accessing memory outside the
      source buffer.
    
    Also there is now a border around the source buffer which has a
    different color than the source buffer itself so that if we sample
    outside, it will show up.
    
    Finally, the test now allows the destination buffer to not be changed
    at all. This allows pixman to simply bail out in cases where the
    transformation too strange.

    Fix conical gradients to match QConicalGradient from Qt
    
    Under the assumption that pixman gradients are supposed to match
    QConicalgradient, described here:
    
            http://doc.trolltech.com/4.4/qconicalgradient.html
    
    this patch fixes two separate bugs in pixman-conical-gradient.c.
    
    The first bug is that the output of atan2() is in the range of [-pi,
    pi], which means the parameter into the gradient can be negative. This
    is wrong since a QConicalGradient always interpolates around the
    center from 0 to 1. The fix for that is to (a) make sure the given
    angle is between 0 and 360, and (b) add or subtract 2 * M_PI if the
    computed angle ends up outside [0, 2 * pi].
    
    The other bug is that we were interpolating clockwise, whereas
    QConicalGradient calls for a counter-clockwise interpolation. This is
    easily fixed by subtracting the parameter from 1.
    
    Finally, this patch encapsulates the computation in a new force-inline
    function so that it can be reused in both the affine and non-affine
    case.

    Make separate gray scanline storers.
    
    For gray formats the palettes are indexed by luminance, not RGB, so we
    can't use the color storers for gray too.

    test: verify that gradients do not crash pixman
    
    Test gradients under particular conditions (no stops, all the stops
    at the same offset) to check that pixman does not misbehave.

    Eliminate mask_bits from all the scanline fetchers.
    
    Back in the day, the mask_bits argument was used to distinguish
    between masks used for component alpha (where it was 0xffffffff) and
    masks for unified alpha (where it was 0xff000000). In this way, the
    fetchers could check if just the alpha channel was 0 and in that case
    avoid fetching the source.
    
    However, we haven't actually used it like that for a long time; it is
    currently always either 0xffffffff or 0 (if the mask is NULL). It also
    doesn't seem worthwhile resurrecting it because for premultiplied
    buffers, if alpha is 0, then so are the color channels
    normally.
    
    This patch eliminates the mask_bits and changes the fetchers to just
    assume it is 0xffffffff if mask is non-NULL.

    test: added OpenMP support for better utilization of multiple CPU cores
    
    Some of the tests are quite heavy CPU users and may benefit from
    using multiple CPU cores, so the programs from 'test' directory
    are now built with OpenMP support. OpenMP is easy to use, portable
    and also takes care of making a decision about how many threads
    to spawn.

    This new script can be used to run continuously to compare two test

    narrow down to a single problematic test from the batch which results
    in different behavior.

    test: main loop from blitters-test added as a new function to utils.c
    
    This new generalized function can be reused in both blitters-test
    and scaling-test. Final checksum calculation changed in order to make
    it parallelizable (it is a sum of individual 32-bit values returned
    by a callback function, which is now responsible for running test-specific
    code). Return values may be crc32, some other hash or even just zero on
    success and non-zero on error (in this case, the expected result of the
    whole test run should be 0).

    Fixes for pthread thread local storage.
    
    The tls_name_key variable is passed to tls_name_get(), and the first
    time this happens it isn't initialized. tls_name_get() then passes it
    on to tls_name_alloc() which passes it on to pthread_setspecific()
    leading to undefined behavior.
    
    None of this is actually necessary at all because there is only one
    such variable per thread local variable, so it doesn't need to passed
    as a parameter at all.
    
    All of this was pointed out by Tor Lillqvist on the cairo mailing
    list.

    ARM: Workaround for a NEON bug in assembler from binutils 2.18
    
    The problem was reported as bug 25534 against pixman in
    freedesktop.org bugzila. Link to a patch for binutils:
    http://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2008-03/msg00260.html
    
    For pixman the impact is a build failure when using
    binutils 2.18. Versions 2.19 and higer are fine. Still
    some distros may be using older versions of binutils and
    this is causing problems.
    
    This patch workarounds the problem by replacing a problematic
    "vmov a, b" instruction with equivalent "vorr a, b, b". Actually
    they even map to the same instruction opcode in the generated
    code, so the resulting binary is identical with and without patch.

    ARM: Use '.object_arch' directive in NEON assembly file
    
    This can be used to override the architecture recorded in the EABI object
    attribute section. We set a minimum arch to 'armv4'. Binutils documentation
    recommends to use this directive with the code performing runtime detection
    of CPU features.
    
    Additionally NEON/VFP EABI attributes are suppressed. And the instruction
    set to use is explicitly set to '.arm'.
    
    Configure test for NEON support is also updated to include a bunch of
    these new directives (if any of these is unsupported by the assembler,
    it is better to fail configure test than to fail library build).
    
    All these changes are required to fix SIGILL problem on armv4t, reported in
    http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/pixman/2010-March/000123.html

    Add specialized fast nearest scalers
    
    This is a macroized version of SRC/OVER repeat normal/unneeded nearest
    neighbour scaling instantiated for some common 8888 and 565 formats.

    Add FAST_PATH_SAMPLES_COVER_CLIP and FAST_PATH_16BIT_SAFE
    
    FAST_PATH_SAMPLES_COVER_CLIP:
    
    This is set of the source sample grid, unrepeated but transformed
    completely completely covers the clip destination. If this is set
    you can use a simple scaled that doesn't have to care about the repeat
    mode.
    
    FAST_PATH_16BIT_SAFE:
    
    This signifies two things:
    1) The size of the src/mask fits in a 16.16 fixed point, so something like:
    
        max_vx = src_image->bits.width << 16;
    
        Is allowed and is guaranteed to not overflow max_vx
    
    2) When stepping the source space we're guaranteed to never overflow
       a 16.16 bit fix point variable, even if we step one extra step
       in the destination space. This means that a loop doing:
    
       x = vx >> 16;
       vx += unit_x;								   d = src_row[x];
    
       will never overflow vx causing x to be negative.
    
       And additionally, if you track vx like above and apply NORMAL repeat
       after the vx addition with something like:
    
       while (vx >= max_vx) vx -= max_vx;
    
       This will never overflow the vx even on the final increment that
       takes vx one past the end of where we will read, which makes the
       repeat loop safe.

    Ensure that only the low 4 bit of 4 bit pixels are stored.
    
    In some cases we end up trying to use the STORE_4 macro with an 8 bit
    values, which resulted in other pixels getting overwritten. Fix this
    by always masking off the low 4 bits.
    
    This fixes blitters-test on big-endian machines.

    On OS X and other systems that don't have __thread, they expand to a
    complicated concoction that uses pthread_once() and
    pthread_get/set_specific() to get thread local variables.

    OS X does not support __thread, so we have to check for it before
    using it.  It does however support pthread_get/setspecific(), so if we
    don't have __thread, check if those are available.

    This patch allows such code to just define PIXMAN_DONT_DEFINE_STDINT

    Store the operator table more compactly.
    
    The four cases for each operator:
    
        none-are-opaque, src-is-opaque, dest-is-opaque, both-are-opaque
    
    are packed into one uint32_t per operator. The relevant strength
    reduced operator can then be found by packing the source-is-opaque and
    dest-is-opaque into two bits and shifting that number of bytes.
    
    Chris Wilson pointed out a bug in the original version of this commit:
    dest_is_opaque and source_is_opaque were used as booleans, but their
    actual values were the results of a logical AND with the
    FAST_PATH_OPAQUE flag, so the shift value was wildly wrong.
    
    The only reason it actually passed the test suite (on x86) was that
    the compiler computed the shift amount in the cl register, and the low
    byte of FAST_PATH_OPAQUE happens to be 0, so no shifting actually took
    place, and the original operator was returned.

    Make the operator strength reduction constant time.
    
    By extending the operator information table to cover all operators we
    can replace the loop with a table look-up. At the same time, base the
    operator optimization on the computed flags rather than the ones in
    the image struct.
    
    Finally, as an extra optimization, we no longer ignore the case where
    there is a mask. Instead we consider the source opaque if both source
    and mask are opaque, or if the source is opaque and the mask is
    missing.

    Move all code to do debugging spew into pixman-private.
    
    Rather than the region code having its own little debug system, move
    all of it into pixman-private where there is already return_if_fail()
    macros etc. These macros are now enabled in development snapshots and
    nowhere else. Previously they were never enabled unless you modified
    the code.
    
    At the same time, remove all the asserts from the region code since we
    can never turn them on anyway, and replace them with
    critical_if_fail() macros that will print spew to standard error when
    DEBUG is defined.
    
    Finally, also change the debugging spew in pixman-bits-image.c to use
    return_val_if_fail() instead of its own fprintf().

    Add a fast path for non-repeating sources in walk_region_internal().
    
    In the common case where there is no repeating, the loop in
    walk_region_internal() reduces to just walking of the boxes involved
    and calling the composite function.

    Eliminate all the composite methods.
    
    They are no longer necessary because we will just walk the fast path
    tables, and the general composite path is treated as another fast
    path.
    
    This unfortunately means that sse2_composite() can no longer be
    responsible for realigning the stack to 16 bytes, so we have to move
    that to pixman_image_composite().

    Make general_composite_rect() just another fast path.
    
    We introduce a new PIXMAN_OP_any fake operator and a PIXMAN_any fake
    format that match anything. Then general_composite_rect() can be used
    as another fast path.
    
    Because general_composite_rect() does not require the sources to cover
    the clip region, we add a new flag FAST_PATH_COVERS_CLIP which is part
    of the set of standard flags for fast paths.
    
    Because this flag cannot be computed until after the clip region is
    available, we have to call pixman_compute_composite_region32() before
    checking for fast paths. This will resolve itself when we get to the
    point where _pixman_run_fast_path() is only called once per composite
    operation.

    selected for a 1x1 solid image, when that fast path doesn't actually

    When fetching from an alpha map, replace the alpha channel of the image
    
    Previously it would be multiplied onto the image pixel, but the Render
    specification is pretty clear that the alpha map should be used
    *instead* of any alpha channel within the image.
    
    This makes the assumption that the pixels in the image are already
    premultiplied with the alpha channel from the alpha map. If we don't
    make this assumption and the image has an alpha channel of its own, we
    would have to first unpremultiply that pixel, and then premultiply the
    alpha value onto the color channels, and then replace the alpha
    channel.

    test: Add new alphamap test program.
    
    This program demonstrates three bugs relating to alpha maps:
    
    - When fetching from an alpha map into 32 bit intermediates, we use
      the fetcher from the image, and not the one from the alpha map.
    
    - For 64 bit intermediates we call fetch_pixel_generic_lossy_32()
      which then calls fetch_pixel_raw_64, which is NULL because alpha
      images are never validated.
    
    - The alpha map should be used *in place* of any existing alpha
      channel, but we are actually multiplying it onto the image.

    region: Enable or disable fatal errors and selfchecks based on version number
    
    There is a couple of bugs in bugzilla where bugs in the X server
    triggered asserts in the pixman region code. It is probably better to
    let the X server survive this. (In fact, I thought I had disabled them
    for 0.16.0, but apparently not).
    
    The patch below uses these rules:
    
        - In _stable_ pixman releases, assertions and selfchecks are turned
          off. Assertions, so that the X server doesn't die. Selfchecks,
          for performance reasons.
    
        - In _unstable_ pixman releases, both assertions and selfcheck are
          turned on. These releases are what get added to development
          distributions such as rawhide, so we want as much self-checking
          as possible.
    
        - In _random git checkouts_, assertions are enabled, so that bugs
          are caught, but selfchecks are disabled so that you can use them
          for performance work without having to fiddle with turning
          selfchecks off.

    ARM: macro template for single scanline compositing functions
    
    Existing template already supports 2D images processing,
    but pixman also needs some NEON optimized functions for
    improving performance when compositing is decoupled
    into "fetch -> process -> store" stages and done via
    temporary scanline buffer. That's why a new simplified
    template which deals only with the generation of single
    scanline processing functions is handy.

    Fix rounding of top and bottom coordinates.
    
    The rules for trap rasterization is that coordinates are rounded
    towards north-west.
    
    The pixman_sample_ceil() function is used to compute the first
    (top-most) sample row included in the trap, so when the input
    coordinate is already exactly on a sample row, no rounding should take
    place.
    
    On the other hand, pixman_sample_floor() is used to compute the final
    (bottom-most) sample row, so if the input is precisely on a sample
    row, it needs to be rounded down to the previous row.
    
    This commit fixes the rounding computation. The idea of the
    computation is like this:
    
    Floor operation that rounds exact matches down: First subtract
    pixman_fixed_e to make sure input already on a sample row gets rounded
    down. Then find out how many small steps are between the input and the
    first fraction. Then add those small steps to the first fraction.
    
    The ceil operation first adds (small_step + pixman_e), then runs a
    floor. This ensures that exact matches are not rounded off.
    
    Based on a patch by M Joonas Pihlaja.

    Fix slightly skewed sampling grid for antialiased traps
    
    The sampling grid is slightly skewed in the antialiased case. Consider
    the case where we have n = 8 bits of alpha.
    
    The small step is
    
         small_step = fixed_1 / 15 = 65536 / 15 = 4369
    
    The first fraction is then
    
         frac_first = (small_step / 2) = (65536 - 15) / 2 = 2184
    
    and the last fraction becomes
    
         frac_last
              = frac_first + (15 - 1) * small_step = 2184 + 14 * 4369 = 63350
    
    which means the size of the last bit of the pixel is
    
         65536 - 63350 = 2186
    
    which is 2 bigger than the first fraction. This is not the end of the
    world, but it would be more correct to have 2185 and 2185, and we can
    accomplish that simply by making the first fraction half the *big*
    step instead of half the small step.
    
    If we ever move to coordinates with 8 fractional bits, the
    corresponding values become 8 and 10 out of 256, where 9 and 9 would
    be better.
    
    Similarly in the X direction.

    Eliminate the NEED_SOLID_MASK flag
    
    This flag was used to indicate that the mask was solid while still
    allowing a specific format to be required. However, there is not
    actually any need for this because the fast paths all used
    _pixman_image_get_solid() which already allowed arbitrary formats.
    
    The one thing that had to be dealt with was component alpha. In
    addition to interpreting the presence of the NEED_COMPONENT_ALPHA
    flag, we now also interprete the *absence* of this flag as a
    requirement that the mask does *not* have component alpha.
    
    Siarhei Siamashka pointed out that the first version of this commit
    had a bug, in which a NEED_SOLID_MASK was accidentally not turned into
    a PIXMAN_solid in the ARM NEON implementation.

    Use the destination buffer directly in more cases instead of fetching.
    
    When the destination buffer is either a8r8g8b8 or x8r8g8b8, we can use
    it directly instead of fetching into a temporary buffer. When the
    format is x8r8g8b8, we require the operator to not make use of
    destination alpha, but when it is a8r8g8b8, there are no restrictions.

    sse2: Add a fast path for OVER 8888 x 8 x 8888
    
    This is a small speedup on the swfdec-youtube benchmark:
    
    Before:
    [  0]    image               swfdec-youtube    5.789    5.806   0.20%    6/6

    Ie., approximately 5% faster.

    ARM: introduction of the new framework for NEON fast path optimizations
    
    GNU assembler and its macro preprocessor is now used to generate
    NEON optimized functions from a common template. This automatically
    takes care of nuisances like ensuring optimal alignment, dealing with
    leading/trailing pixels, doing prefetch, etc.
    
    Implementations for a lot of compositing functions are also added,
    but not enabled.

    Speed up bilinear interpolation.
    
    Speed up bilinear interpolation by processing more than one component
    at a time on 64 bit architectures, and by precomputing the dist{ixiy}
    products on 32 bit architectures.
    
    Previously bilinear interpolation for one pixel would take 24
    multiplications. With this improvement it takes 12 on 64 bit, and 20
    on 32 bit.
    
    This is a small but consistent speedup on the swfdec-youtube
    benchmark:
    
    [ # ]  backend                         test   min(s) median(s) stddev. count

    As an interim measure, replace AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([dist-bzip2]) with
    AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([foreign dist-bzip2]). This will prevent the generation
    of the INSTALL file. It is also part of the 24206 solution.

    This commit fixes that by making the FETCH/STORE_4 macros first
    convert the index to bit position.

    bits, making the resulting alpha channel 0.

    Revert "Enable component alpha on solid masks."
    
    For consistency we will probably want to allow component alpha to be
    set on all masks at some point, but this commit only enabled it for
    solid images.
    
    This reverts commit 29e22cf38e8abc54b9dddbdeb3909d02866a82a0.

    Don't prefetch from NULL in the SSE2 fast paths.
    
    On an Athlon64 box prefetch from NULL slows down
    the rgba OVER rgba fast for predominantly solid sources
    by up to 3.5x in the one-rounded-rectangle test case
    when run using a tiling polygon renderer.  This patch
    conditionalises the prefetches of the mask everywhere
    where the mask pointer may be NULL in a fast path.

    ARM: Remove fallback to ARMv6 implementation from NEON delegate chain
    
    This can help to fix build problems with '-mthumb' gcc option in CFLAGS.
    ARMv6 optimized code can't be compiled for thumb (because of its inline
    assembly) and gets automatically disabled in configure. Reference
    to it from NEON optimized code resulted in linking problems.
    
    Every ARMv6 optimized fast path function also has a better NEON
    counterpart, so there is no need to fallback to ARMv6. Shorter
    delegate chain should additionally result in a bit better performance.

    Another error is that it was testing src, not mask as it should.

    HACK: updated test to better cover new neon optimizations

    Test program for stressing the use of different formats and operators
    
    The code and overall method is mostly based on scaling-test. This one
    focuses on trying to stress as many different color formats and types
    of composition operations as possible.
    
    This is an initial implementation which may need more tuning. Also
    not all color format and operator combinations are actually used.
    
    When cpu specific optimizations are disabled, this test provides
    identical deterministic results on x86, PPC and ARM.
    
    Script blitters-test-bisect.rb now works in non-stop mode, until
    it finds any problem. This allows to run it for example overnight
    in order to test a lot more variants of pixman calls and increase
    chances of detecting problems in pixman. Just like with scaling-test,
    running blitters-test binary alone with no command line arguments
    runs a small predefined number of tests and compares checksum
    with a reference value for quick verification.

    Fix vmx_combine_out_reverse_ca()
    
    The source alpha is just one component, not four.

    Fix vmx_over_reverse_ca()
    
    Destination alpha must be extracted after inversing, otherwise we end
    up with 0xFFs in the rgb channels.

    Make pix_add_mul() in pixman-mmx.c produce exact results.
    
    Previously this routine would compute (x * a + y * b) / 255. Now it
    computes (x * a) / 255 + (y * b) / 255, so that the results are
    bitwise equivalent to the non-mmx versions.

    Rewrite the two-component arithmetic macros.
    
    Previously they were not bit-for-bit equivalent to the one-component
    versions. The new code is also simpler and easier to read because it
    factors out some common sub-macros.
    
    The x * a + y * b macro now only uses four multiplications - the
    previous version used eight.

    Fix incorrect optimization in combine_over_ca().
    
    Previously the code assumed that an alpha of 0 meant that no change
    would take place. This is incorrect because an alpha of 0 can happen
    as the result of the source having alpha=0, but rgb != 0.

    Soeren rightfully complained that I had removed all the comments from

    scanline and how we can therefore reduce the per-pixel cost of evaluating
    B.

    Add implementation of MMX __m64 functions for MSVC x64.
    
    Microsoft C++ does not define __m64 and all related MMX functions in
    x64.  However, it succeeds in generating object files for SSE2 code
    inside pixman.
    
    The real problem happens during linking, when it cannot find MMX functions
    (which are not defined as intrinsics for AMD64 platform).
    
    I have implemented those missing functions using general programming.
    
    MMX __m64 is used relatively scarcely within SSE2 implementation, and the
    performance impact probably is negligible.

commit c7b84f8b043018368fade4ad13730cfcaaf5c8cc
Author: Søren Sandmann Pedersen <sandmann@redhat.com>
Date:   Tue Jul 21 00:17:15 2009 -0400

    Only apply the workaround if the clip region extends beyond the drawable.
    
    This works because the X server always attempts to set a clip region
    within the bounds of the drawable, and it only fails at it when it is
    computing the wrong translation and therefore needs the workaround.

commit 6bd17f1e9861693262fa88bfeff5d3279b3f6e7d
Author: Søren Sandmann Pedersen <sandmann@redhat.com>
Date:   Mon Jul 20 23:46:06 2009 -0400

    Rework the workaround for bogus X server images.
    
    Bug 22844 demonstrates that it is not sufficient to play tricks with
    the clip regions to work around the bogus images from the X
    server. The problem there is that if the operation hits the general
    path and the destination has a different format than a8r8g8b8, the
    destination pixels will be fetched into a temporary array. But because
    those pixels would be outside the clip region, they would be fetched
    as black. The previous workaround was relying on fast paths fetching
    those pixels without checking the clip region.
    
    In the new scheme we work around the problem at the
    pixman_image_composite() level. If an image is determined to need a
    work around, we translate both the bits pointer, the coordinates, and
    the clip region, thus effectively undoing the X server's broken
    computation.

    Some of the variables in the inline assembly arguments list are
    actually modified by the assembly code, they are now marked
    appropriately.

    ARM: Workaround cs2007q3 compiler bug for NEON registers clobber list
    
    128-bit registers "qX" are incorrectly handled in inline assembly
    clobber list for codesourcery cs2007q3 gcc toolchain. Only the
    first 64-bit half is saved and restored by gcc. Changing clobber
    list to use only 64-bit register aliases can solve this problem.
    For example, 128-bit register q0 is mapped to two 64-bit
    registers d0 and d1, q1 is mapped to d2 and d3, etc.

    Add a lot more sanity checks to region code
    
    - Introduce a GOOD_RECT() macro that checks that a pixman_box_t is not
      empty or degenerate an use it.
    - Use GOOD_RECT() instead of magic if statements for funtions that take
      x, y, width, height arguments
    - Use GOOD_RECT() in _reset(). The checks in the previous code seemed to
      allow an empty box, but then created a broken region from it.
    - Add GOOD(region) check at the end of _translate()

    Fix bits_image_fetch_{un}transformed() for 64 bit buffers.
    
    The buffer pointer has to advance twice as far as in the 32 bit case.

    Make sure we get all 64 bits in bits_image_fetch_solid_64()
    
    Previously we would only store the first 32 bits.

    Move workaround logic to pixman-bits-image.c.
    
    Instead of computing whether a workaround is needed on every call to
    _pixman_run_fast_path(), just cache this information in the image.
    
    Also, when workarounds are needed, clip against the source geometry to
    prevent out of bound reads.

    Add workarounds for X servers doing out-of-bounds accesses.
    
    Old X servers rely on out-of-bounds accesses when they are asked
    to composite with a window as the source. They create a pixman image
    pointing to some bogus position in memory, but then they set a clip
    region to the position where the actual bits are.
    
    Due to a bug in old versions of pixman, where it would not clip
    against the image bounds when a clip region was set, this would
    actually work.
    
    The workaround added by this commit is to try and detect whether a
    source drawable is actually a window without a client clip set. Such a
    window will generally have a clip region that corresponds exactly to
    the hierarchy clip in the server, whereas pixmaps will have a clip
    region that is an exact match to the drawable.
    
    When we detect such a window, we allow a fast path to run that would
    normally be rejected due to the sources not completely subsuming the
    composite region.
    
    Fixed X servers should call the new function
    pixman_disable_out_of_bounds_workaround() to disable the workaround.
    
    This was reported in bug 22484.

    Update the CRC value in scaling-test.c.
    
    The changes in pixman behavior justifying this are:
    
    - New clipping rules
    
    - Bug fixes in region code. In particular, when
      pixman_region_init_rects() is called on these two boxes:
    
    	{ 2, 6, 7, 6 }
    	{ 4, 1, 6, 7 }
    
      it now ignores the first one, which is empty and produces
    
    	{ 4, 1, 6, 7 }
    
      Previously, it would produce:
    
    	{ 2, 1, 7, 7 }
    
      for some reason.

    It is not generally correct to bail out just because the source alpha

    result is:
    
           s + (1 - srca) * d = s + d
    
    which is not generally 0.

    Option -mcpu has higher priority than -march with the current versions

    reason why 'arm1136j-s' is used in this patch, it could be any armv6
    compatible core.

Date:   Wed Jun 24 11:28:03 2009 -0400

    Fix offset bug in pixman_run_fast_path().
    
    Fast paths should only run when the source images complete cover the
    composite region, because otherwise they would be required to sample
    the border, and fast paths generally don't know how to do that.
    
    The check for this did not work right because it didn't take the
    offset generated by the composite coordinates into account. This
    commits fixes that by adding (x, y) coordinates to image cover
    indicating the new position of the source in destination coordinates.
    
    Based on this we now compare against the region extents which are
    already in destination coordinates.

    Remove support for component alpha with HSL blend modes.
    
    It isn't clear that component alpha makes sense with HSL blend modes.

    Remove FLASH_SUBTRACT blend mode.
    
    We may resurrect it later, but leave it out for now, as the closest
    thing we have to a spec:
    
    http://www.kaourantin.net/2005/09/some-word-on-blend-modes-in-flash.html
    
    claims that alpha values should be subtracted, whereas real-world flash
    files indicate that they shouldn't.

    [NEON] Add transparent rect blitter.

commit 8eeeca993252edc39da9c5c57545b81215fafc81
Author: Jonathan Morton <jmorton@sd070.hel.movial.fi>
Date:   Tue Jun 16 12:08:29 2009 -0400

    [NEON] Replace Ian's glyph-blitter with a better one.
    
    Each scanline of the destination is bulk-loaded into a cached buffer on
    the stack (using the QuadWordCopy routine) before being processed.  This
    is the primary benefit on uncached framebuffers, since it is necessary
    to minimise the number of accesses to such things and avoid
    write-to-read turnarounds.
    
    This also simplifies edge handling, since QuadWordCopy() can do a
    precise writeback efficiently via the write-combiner, allowing the main
    routine to "over-read" the scanline edge safely when required.  This is
    why the glyph's mask data is also copied into a temporary buffer of
    known size.
    
    Each group of 8 pixels is then processed using fewer instructions,
    taking advantage of the lower precision requirements of the 6-bit
    destination (so a simpler pixel multiply can be used) and using a more
    efficient bit-repacking method.
    
    (As an aside, this patch removes nearly twice as much code as it
    introduces.  Most of this is due to duplication of Ian's inner loop,
    since he has to handle narrow cases separately.  RVCT support is of
    course preserved.)
    
    We measured the doubling of performance by rendering 96-pixel height
    glyph strings, which are fillrate limited rather than latency/overhead
    limited.  The performance is also improved, albeit by a smaller amount,
    on the more usual smaller text, demonstrating that internal overhead is
    not a problem.

    relied on pixman not clipping to destination geometry whenever an
    explicit clip region was set. Since only X servers set
    source_clipping, we can just trigger off of that.

    Simplify clipping rule
    
    The new rule is:
    
    - Output is clipped to the destination clip region.
    
    - If a source image has the clip_sources property set, then there
      is an additional step, after repeating and transforming, but before
      compositing, where pixels that are not in the source clip are
      rejected. Rejected means no compositing takes place (not that the
      pixel is treated as 0). By default source clipping is turned off;
      when they are turned on, only client-set clips are honored.
    
    The old rules were unclear and inconsistently implemented.

    pixman: define pixman_have_{mmx,sse2} on 64-bit Linux
    
    The refactoring of pixman removed pixman-sse2.h and pixman-mmx.h in commit
    41a9a17e0308f2075bb1bd59c4411e43a67d49ec
    (http://cgit.freedesktop.org/pixman/commit/?id=41a9a17e0308f2075bb1bd59c4411e43a67d49ec).
    On 64-bit Linux this breaks linking of new programs as well as execution of
    existing programs with the following errors:
    
    ../pixman/.libs/libpixman-1.so: undefined reference to `pixman_have_mmx'
    ../pixman/.libs/libpixman-1.so: undefined reference to `pixman_have_sse2'
    
    This patch fixes the issue for me by re-introducing the definitions for these
    functions. It might be preferable, though, to create proper trivial static
    inline functions instead.

    Fix alpha map computation in pixman_compute_composite_region()
    
    According to the RENDER spec, the origin of the alpha map is
    interpreted relative to the origin of the drawable of the image, not
    the origin of the drawable of the alpha map.
    
    This commit fixes that and adds an alpha-test.c test program.
    
    The only use of alpha maps I have been able to find is in Qt and they
    don't use a non-zero alpha origin.

    Don't read potentially uninitialized data in pixman_CombineMaskU()
    
    This is mainly to quiet valgrind. The data in question would only be
    uninitialized when the corresponding mask pixel was zero, so the end
    result is zero in any case.

    Fix overflows during trap rasterization. [Bug 16560].
    
    Avoid overflows when rasterizing traps that fall entirely in the space
    between the final sample row and the end of the coordinate system, or
    in the space between the beginning of the coordinate system and the
    first sample row. Such traps don't contain any sample points, so the
    top and bottom of the edges can safely be moved to the beginning/end.

    Fixed rendering bug for source alpha == 0 in OVER fastpath functions
    
    Handling of the case when source alpha is zero was keeping destination
    pixel unmodified. But this is different from how generic path behaves.
    For example fbOver(0x00200483, 0x9CAC7E9F) == 0x9CCC82FF and the
    destination pixel changes from 0x9CAC7E9F to 0x9CCC82FF in spite
    of having zero alpha.

    Updated scaling test to support rgb565, source clipping, etc.
    
    Now test provides better coverage for various image scaling
    cases. Unused byte for x8r8g8b8 format is ignored. Running
    the test program without any command line options provides
    a PASS/FAIL verdict based on the precalculated crc32 value
    for using pixman with all the fastpath functions disabled,
    which should simplify testing for correcteness.

    Set srcRepeat = False when using fbCompositeSrcScaleNearest
    
    NORMAL repeat was broken (the optimized function can handle repeat operation
    itself and can be screwed up if 'pixman_walk_composite_region' tries to help it
    by splitting the work into handling multiple separate areas).
    
    Splitting work into handling different areas does not work right for the
    transform case (and it is never used for generic path).  The point is that this
    splitting only has full pixel precision at the moment, while correct blitting
    needs to preserve some fractional part in calculations when moving from one
    "tile" to another.

    Various pieces of code expect PIXMAN_FORMAT_COLOR (and its less cool older
    brother, PICT_FORMAT_COLOR) formats to have ARGB bits, and the YUV formats do
    not.

    [arm-simd] Add a comment about aligning source and destination pointers.

    Check alignment of 'src' pointer in optimized ARM routines
    
    fbCompositeSrcAdd_8000x8000arm() tries to align 'dst' already but must check
    'src' too.  Otherwise, the next 4-byte copy loop might access an odd 'src' address
    causing an alignment trap.

    Optimize rectilinear nearest-neighbour scaling
    
    Add a special case for a source transformation that is only a scale and
    preserves rectangular pixels and doesn't rotate the image. Currently, only
    SOURCE is special cased, however I plan to do more work in this area as needed.
    The biggest advantage the specialization currently has is writing directly to
    the destination surface instead of a temporary scanline buffer. However, it is
    still pretty unoptimized but I want to keep things simple for now.

    Unify scanline buffer types
    
    Change the type of the stack based scanline buffer to uint8_t to match the rest
    of the variables. Also premultiply the scanline buffer size by sizeof(uint32_t)
    because the bpp can be either sizeof(uint32_t) or sizeof(uint64_t).

    Rename the current ARM code to ARM SIMD
    
    This code is only for CPUs supporting the SIMD instructions, not for all ARM
    CPUs.
    
    I stumbled above the recent commit with the ARM SIMD code while preparing a
    patch that models the patch from #13445 after the MMX and SSE2 cases:
    
    The ARM SIMD option currently uses --disable-arm, although this code is only
    for CPUs >= ARMv6. That's as if one would call the option to disable the SSE2
    code --disable-x86.
    
    This patch therefore renames the configure option and the function and file
    names to arm-simd/arm_simd.

    The previous code assumed a color format of ABGR when naming the

    renames the variables just to avoid confusion.

    Move _mm_empty() to correct place
    
    The "fbComposeSetupSSE2()" function is guarding most of its code
    depending on the capabilities of the CPU, but unfortunately the call
    to "_mm_empty()" is not part of this code path but executed
    unconditionally.  This results in a "illegal instruction" crash on
    non-MMX / non-SSE capable CPUs caused by the the "emms" instruction
    (embedded in "_mm_empty()").
    
    Fix bug 17729.

    Inline fetch functions in pixman-transformed.c
    
    There was significant performance overhead associated with indirect
    call to the fetch functions, so inline them.
    
    Also, the old code assumed that if the number of rectangles in the
    source clip was 1, then the clip was identical to the image
    boundaries. Fix that by running a full region_contains_point()
    whenever the source clip is different from pict->common.full_region.

    Add a lossy 32-bit generic pixel fetch function for wide surfaces.
    
    The transformed fetch path currently only works at 32-bit precision.  Until a
    wide version of that function is added, we need to have a path to perform a
    wide FetchPixel and then contract it down to a8r8g8b8.
    
    Also, use the right format when expanding the result in fbFetchTransformed64.
    fbFetchTransformed returns a8r8g8b8 results.

    Add wide source picture, external alpha, and transformed image routines.
    
    The wide external alpha path should work correctly with wide formats.  The wide
    transformed fetch code for now just does a 32-bit fetch and then expands, which
    will lose precision.  Source pictures, for now, are evaluated at depth 32 and
    then are expanded to depth 64.  We could get higher precision by evaluating them
    directly at depth 64, but this should be good enough for now.

    Work around GCC bug causing crashes in Mozilla with SSE2
    
    When using SSE2 intrinsics, gcc assumes that the stack is 16 byte
    aligned. Unfortunately some code, such as Mozilla and Mono contain
    code that aligns the stack to 4 bytes.
    
    The __force_align_arg_pointer__ makes gcc generate a prologue that
    realigns the stack pointer to 16 bytes.  Fix bug 15693.

    will be 0.9.8 with an even-number micro component).

    Document incrementing the micro version immediately after a release
    
    This is a cairo-like scheme where the version number is incremented
    both immediately before and immediately after a release.

    Fix the SSE related AMD64 build breakage
    
    The introduction of pixman_have_sse() copied the #ifdef __amd64__
    found around pixman_have_mmx() in pixman-mmx.c but didn't include the
    equivalents of the macros in pixman-mmx.h. As a result, the AMD64 link
    fails because the pixman_have_sse() function doesn't exist.
    
    I also introduced header inclusion guards to pixman-mmx.h and
    pixman-sse.h while I was at it.

    Add rounding epsilon for NEAREST filter after transformation, not before.
    
    For nearest filtering, the transformed location must be rounded to the
    nearest sample. For locations that precisely in the middle between two
    samples, we round down by adding -epsilon to the coordinates.
    
    Before, we would do this on untransformed coordinates. This patch
    changes it to happen after transformation. It also clarifies the
    difference between sample locations and rounding.

    Do not attempt to allocate bits if either the image width or height is

    as an out-of-memory error.

    making it from the source to the destination.

    rasterize traps that extend outside of the image bounds correctly
    
    Traps that extend outside of the image bounds are rasterized incorrectly
    currently; the problem is a signed vs. unsigned comparison that got
    introduced when a width parameter went from int -> uint.  This patch
    puts it back to int (since it's stored as an int in the bits structure
    to begin with), and also fixes a similar warning in the memset wrapper

    pixman_composite_rect_general_accessors skips the fetch / store steps by setting

    This optimization is only valid when no accessors are in play.

    Use the general code in some cases even when a fast path is available
    
    If src or mask are repeating 1x1 images and srcRepeat or
    maskRepeat are still TRUE, it means the fast path we
    selected does not actually handle repeating images.
    So rather than call the "fast path" with a zillion
    1x1 requests, we just use the general code (which does
    do something sensible with 1x1 repeating images).
