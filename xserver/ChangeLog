    Fix key repeats during VT switch.
    
    Add keyc->postdown, which represents the key state as of the last mieqEnqueue
    call, and use it when we need to know the posted state, instead of the
    processed state (keyc->down).  Add small functions to getevents.c to query and
    modify key state in postdown and use them all through, eliminating previously
    broken uses.

    Deliver correct event when releasing keys on VT switch.
    
    In commit 41bb9fce47f6366cc3f7d45790f7883f74289b5a, the event delivery loop
    for Xinput enabled keyboards was changed and accidentally used the wrong
    index variable, causing random events to be delivered when returning from VT
    switch.
    
    In addition, in commit aeba855b07832354f59678e20cc29a085e42bd99,
    SIGIO was blocked during delivery of these events, but not for the entire
    period the xf86Events array was being used. Block SIGIO for the whole loop
    to avoid other event delivery from trashing the key release events.

    Fix server version reporting to be the server package version.
    
    Previously, the server version reported by xdpyinfo and Xorg -version would
    bear some vague resemblance to a X.Org katamari version, but in the presence
    of modularization (and client-server relationships with different katamari
    versions on each side) those numbers don't really make sense.  Instead, just
    report the package version.
    
    When branching a stable branch, master's version should be immediately updated
    to the endpoint of the stable branch plus a snapshot of 1 (for example,
    1.4.0.1 after server-1.4-branch).  The stable branch should then be changed to
    RC0 at that time (1.3.99.0, for example).
    
    This scheme was partially attempted for server 1.3, but lacked the appropriate
    master updates, thus why it had to be revisited now.  While here, we can also
    remove a lot of versioning complexity since everything is based on the package
    version.

    [COMPOSITE] Composite used for pixmap population on redirect. (Bug #7447)
    
    compNewPixmap copies bits from the parent window to the redirected child
    pixmap to populate the pixmap with reasonable data. It cannot always use
    CopyArea as that only works across matching depths. Use Composite when
    the depths do not match.

    [RANDR] Compare only milliseconds of config time. (Bug #6502)
    
    The timestamp transferred in the X protocol is a 32-bit number of
    milliseconds.
    
    The timestamp stored in the server is a structure that contains two fields:
    months (!) and milliseconds.
    
    When the server passes the config timestamp to the client, it discards the
    months part and sends only the milliseconds part.
    
    When the server receives the config timestamp from the client, it tries to
    guess the "months" part by looking at the current time and then maybe adding
    or
    subtracting one.  The guess is wrong after the server has been running long
    enough (several hours).
    
    I have added two ErrorF calls around the 'if' statement that returns
    RRSetConfigInvalidConfigTimestamp in randr/randr.c and my Xorg.0.log has
    this:
    
      randr request got good config time: 0:-2103495671
    
    for the first few successful xrandr calls, and
    
      randr request failed with RRSetConfigInvalidConfigTime: client passed
      1:-2103495671, server has 0:-2103495671
    
    when it fails.  The server has been running for 8 and a half hours.
    
    The obvious fix would be to ignore the months field and only compare the
    milliseconds.

    Fixing a misleading comment which could suggest a GPL violation.
    
    The author of the int10 code looked at the VBIOS POSTing code
    in DOSEMU to get some initial idea on how to POST a VBIOS.
    To give credit to the DOSEMU Team for this inspiration a comment
    was added to the code which could suggest that code from the
    GPLed DOSEMU was directly incorporated into this code.
    This patch should clearify the situation.

    after RRScanOldConfig is finished running. Instead, just use the first
    output (which is the only output present with an old driver, after all).

    Updates some piece of the dead mouse evdev code under the new hotplug scheme.
    I exported the evdev driver to Xephyr server. I'm running it using something
    like:
        $ ./hw/kdrive/ephyr/Xephyr :1 -mouse evdev,,device=/dev/input/event4 -keybd \
        evdev,,device=/dev/input/event1,xkbmodel=abnt2,xkblayout=br
    
    It also closes /#5668.

    When we call Xephyr with '-pointer' a new pointer is added inside the server
    and the Xephyr virtual mouse keeps alive. With this patch the semantic changes
    turning '-pointer' && 'Xephyr virtual mouse' always false.
    
    Now we can open a device pointer and pass its options in Xephyr's command line
    without having other pointer unused.

    Add a new API entry point which lets a driver select the old behaviour if

    Add proper COPYING file
    
    I went through the entire xorg-server distribution and aggregated all
    the licenses I could find (except the questionable GPL files, see my
    last mail).
    
    There are many many permutations on essentially the same license terms,
    but I have been pedantic and treated slight differences as separate
    licenses.
    
    Here is a description of the process I used:
    
    tar xvjf /usr/portage/distfiles/xorg-server-1.1.1.tar.bz2
    
    cd xorg-server-1.1.1
    find -name '*.c' -o -name '*.h' | xargs gvim
    
    egrep -Rli "permission|copyright" * | grep -v "\.[ch]" \
            | grep -v "\.in$" | xargs gvim
    
    cd ..
    tar xvjf /usr/portage/distfiles/xorg-server-1.3.0.0.tar.bz2
    diff -urNp xorg-server-1.1.1 xorg-server-1.3.0.0
    
    git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/xserver
    cd xserver
    git diff xorg-server-1.3.0.0..
    
    For each file, licenses have been aggregated as follows:
    
    If 2 files have identical license text but different copyright notices,
    the copyright notices are aggregated and the license text
    is included only once.
    
    Note that by identical I mean really identical, i.e.:
     'AUTHOR(S)' is not the same as 'AUTHORS'
     'KEITH PACKARD DISCLAIMS' is not the same as 'KEITH PACKARD AND COMPAQ
    DISCLAIM'
    
    Otherwise, licenses and accompanying copyright notices have been
    stacked.
    
    When going through the changes from 1.1.1 to 1.3.0.0 then HEAD, licenses
    have been added and removed (so I have reflected this since the original
    version of my COPYING file). It's slightly concerning to see that even
    between 1.3.0.0 and HEAD, new license permutations are being added. I'd
    suggest that a primary license be chosen and this would be indicated at
    the top of this COPYING file.

    Input: Fix stuck modifiers (bug #11683)
    
    Disclaimer: It's 6:51am.  I'm trying to be as understandable as possible.
    
    What was happening previously was this:
     * Press Alt
     * Extended event generated and processed: state is now Alt down once
     * Core event generated
       - keyboard switched: inherited state is Alt down once
       - event processed: Alt down twice
     * Release Alt
     * Extended event generated and processed: state is now null
     * Core event generated and processed: Alt down once
    
    If we switch the order:
     * Press Alt
     * Core event generated:
      - keyboard switched: inherited state is null
      - event processed: Alt down once
     * Extended event generated and processed: state is now Alt down once
     * Release Alt
     * Core event generated and processed: state is now null
     * Extended event generated and processed: state is now null
    
    When we carry over the previous state, it needs to be the _previous_ state
    (state and modifiersPerKey), assuming that we're going to catch now-core
    events for any of these.  For example, if Ctrl is held down as we pivot, we
    need to carry Ctrl over with a count of one, for which an extended + core
    release will then clear.  Carrying over the union of the previous state _and
    the state resulting from the immediate action_ was what broke things.

    Fonts: Fix builtin fonts

    rather than having it as a fixed path for a while, then clobbering it
    halfway through startup.

    request.  Also, try to return all devices added, not just the first,
    and box device arguments.

    Hotplug: Separate D-Bus into core and hotplug API components
    
    Break up D-Bus into two components: a D-Bus core that can be used by any
    part of the server (for the moment, just the D-Bus hotplug API, and the
    forthcoming HAL hotplug API), and the old D-Bus hotplug API.

    exaGetPixmapFirstPixel: avoid framebuffer readbacks if possible.
    
    If the pixel in framebuffer memory isn't modified since we uploaded it, we
    can just read from the system memory copy, wihch avoids both a readback and
    an accelerator stall.
    
    In principle this function is still wrong, and all the framebuffer pixel
    access should be going through (w)fb so we can get pixel layout corrections.

    Screen size bounds check in ProcRRSetCrtcConfig not masking out reflections.
    
    When checking how to validate the selected mode and position against the
    current screen size, the test against 90/270 rotation did not mask out
    reflection, so that when reflection was specified, the 90/270 test would
    never succeed. This caused incorrect bounds checking and would return
    an error to the user instead of rotating the screen.

    Fix MEMORY SMASH in XkbCopyKeymap.
    
    XkbCopyKeymap reallocates the destination keymap when it is not large enough
    to hold the source data. When reallocating the map->types data, it needs to
    zero out the new entries. The computation for where to start bzero'ing was
    accounting for the size of the data type twice, once implicitly in the
    pointer arithmetic, and once explicitly with '* sizeof (XkbKeyTypeRec)'.
    This would often lead to random memory corruption when the destination
    keymap had existing map->types data.

    Have Composite always report server version.
    
    It was reporting the lessor of the server and client versions, which doesn't
    make sense with the 0.4 semantic change in clipping.

commit 4f88d68bdb90cc7d12170355105b4fd020acd306
Author: Keith Packard <keithp@neko.keithp.com>
Date:   Tue Jul 3 14:43:17 2007 -0700

    Force advertised Composite version to 0.4 instead of using header version.
    
    Installed protocol header version may be newer than the server code base.
    Use internal version number for Composite extension to make sure the server
    doesn't advertise capabilities it doesn't support.

    Make Composite manual redirect windows not clip their parent.
    
    This patch changes the semantics of manual redirect windows so that they no
    longer affect the clip list of their parent. Doing this means the parent can
    draw to the area covered by the child without using IncludeInferiors. More
    importantly, this also means that the parent receives expose events when
    that region is damaged by other actions.

    exaGetImage: Don't migrate or try to accelerate for 1x1.
    
    This is mainly to avoid wasting effort for XSync(), but just reading a single

    light of the latter, even larger thresholds might be useful.
    
    Also move the swappedOut check before the migration checks because migration
    can't actually occur when swapped out.

    This is to avoid issues with redirected windows which are located partly or

    Remove the old Kerberos 5 authentication code.
    
    Before you complain, this code hasn't seen material change since at least
    X11R6.  It certainly does not build with any modern version of Kerberos.
    Anybody wanting krb5 auth to their X server should probably be using
    GSSAPI instead of internal krb5 API anyway.

    xf86XVFillKeyHelper assumed root clip never changed.
    
    When the root window changed size, xf86XVFillKeyHelper would not revalidate
    the GC, leaving the clip at the old size causing lossage (and possibly
    memory corruption if the screen and frame buffer shrank).
    
    Fixed by just using a scratch GC; saving memory, eliminating bugs and
    shrinking the code.

    AIGLX: Zero-copy texture-from-pixmap.
    
    When available, use the 2D driver texOffsetStart hook and the 3D driver
    setTexOffset hook to save the overhead of passing the pixmap data to
    glTex(Sub)Image.
    
    The basic idea is to update the driver specific 'offset' for bound pixmaps
    before dispatching a GLX render request and to flush immediately afterwards
    if there are any pixmaps bound. This should ensure that the 3D driver can
    use pixmaps for texturing directly regardless of the X server moving them
    around.

    DRI: Add TexOffset driver hooks.
    
    To be used by AIGLX for GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap without several data copies.
    
    The texOffsetStart hook must make sure that the given pixmap is accessible by
    the GPU for texturing and return an 'offset' that can be used by the 3D
    driver for that purpose.
    
    The texOffsetFinish hook is called when the pixmap is no longer being used for
    texturing.

    Disable all outputs and crtcs at startup.
    
    Leaving devices enabled during server startup can cause problems during the
    initial mode setting in the server, especially when they are used for
    different purposes by the X server than by the BIOS. Disabling all of them
    before any mode setting is attempted provides a stable base upon which the
    remaining mode setting operations can be built.

    Disable Simba PCI bridge routing code (Bug #8020).
    
    The code in hw/xfree86/os-support/bus/sparcPci.c:simbaCheckBus()
    is trying to mimmick VGA routing by disabling I/O space responses
    behind the Simba PCI-PCI controller.
    
    Unfortunately, doing this also happens to disable access to the
    IDE controller I/O space registers, thus crashing the system.  The
    granularity of the I/O disabling in the Simba controller is not
    fine enough to disable VGA without also disabling the IDE controller
    registers.

    Add more informative logging for module default loading
    
    When the modules section is parsed, if a module is set to be loaded by
    default, this will be logged. If it is redundantly specified in xorg.conf,
    this will also be noted. None of this logging will happen if the xorg.conf
    lacks a modules section.

    Provide UseDefaultFontPath option
    
    This provides a new option, UseDefaultFontPath. This option is enabled by
    default, and causes the X server to always append the default font path
    (defined at compile time) to the font path for the server. This will allow
    people to specify additional font paths if they want without breaking
    their font path, thus hopefully avoiding ye olde "fixed front" problem.
    
    Because this option is a ServerFlag option, the ServerFlags need to be
    processed before the files section of the config file, so swap the order
    that they are processed.

    Improve modules loading defaults
    
    Provide default modules that may be overrided easily. Previously the
    server would load a set of default modules, but only if none were
    specified in the xorg.conf, or if you didn't have a xorg.conf at all. This
    patch provides a default set and you can add only the "Load" instructions
    to xorg.conf that you want without losing the defaults. Similarly, if you
    don't want to load a module that's loaded by default, you can add "Disable
    modulename" to your xorg.conf (see man xorg.conf in this release for
    details). This allows for a minimal "Modules" section, where the user only
    need specify what they want to be different. See bug #10541 for more.
    
    The list of default modules is taken from the set loaded by default when
    there was a xorg.conf containing no "Modules" section.
    
    A potential problem for some users is that some users disable a module,
    most notably DRI, by commenting out the "Load" line in their xorg.conf.
    This needs to be changed to an uncommented "Disable" line, as DRI is
    loaded by default.

    New fbWalkCompositeRegion() function
    
    This new function walks the composite region and calls a rectangle

    miext/rootles/safealpha/safeAlphaPicture.c.

    In __glXCreateARGBConfig(), insert the new GL mode at the _end_ of the linked list.
    
    Previously, the new mode was added at the head of the list.  This caused the
    positional correspondence between modes and the XMesaVisuals array to be off
    by one.  The net result was GLX clients failing when they tried to use the
    last GLX mode/visual.
    
    We still have the problem of DRI drivers not being able to use the extra
    mode/visual introduced by __glXCreateARGBConfig().  glXCreateContext fails
    with BadAlloc if it's attempted.  This is also the source of the often-
    seen warning "libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual xxx"
    Look into fixing that someday...

    Fix a buffer overrun on machines with excessively large PCI busses.
    
    Formerly we sized an array with a compile time constant, then initialized
    its size to the same constant, but the Linux PCI init code would increase
    that "constant".  So if you happened to have more than 128 PCI devices,
    you'd happily scribble into whatever variables happened to be in .bss
    after that array.
    
    Only really fixed for Linux atm.  Other OSes will simply (still) fail to
    work on video devices above the 128th PCI device.

        Fix up the fast-path compositing operators; those are useful for
        sources without alpha, but can't be used for sources with
        alpha. Also, replaced fbCompositeSrcSrc_nxn with call to fbBlt as
        this function must handle 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32 bpp objects. Would
        be nice to optimize fbBlt for common cases involving 8, 16, 24 and
        32bpp.

    Disable SourceValidate in rotation to capture cursor.
    
    SourceValidate is used exclusively by the software cursor code to pull the
    cursor off of the screen before using the screen as a source operand. This
    eliminates the software cursor from the frame buffer while painting the
    rotated image though. Disabling this function by temporarily setting the
    screen function pointer to NULL causes the cursor image to be captured.

    Was accidentally disabling rotation updates in mode set.
    
    Setting a mode on an unrotated CRTC was causing all of the rotation updates
    to be disabled; the loop looking for active rotation wasn't actually looking
    at each crtc, it was looking at the modified crtc many times.

    Changes for single-entity multi-screen DRI.
    
    The entity (device) has a locking SAREA and a master file descriptor
    that optionally isn't closed between server generation.
    
    The locking SAREA contains the device hardware lock.
    Each DRI screen creates an new SAREA containing the drawable lock,
    drawable-and private info, the drawable SAREA.
    
    The first screen optionally shares its drawable SAREA with the
    device SAREA.
    
    Default is to close the master descriptor between server generations,
    and to share the drawable SAREA of the first screen with the device locking
    SAREA. Thus we should (hopefully) have full backwards compatibility.
    
    Mesa changes to support single-device multiple screens are pending.

    Disable CRTC when SetSingleMode has no matching mode. Update RandR as well.
    
    xf86SetSingleMode tries to resize all crtcs to match the selected mode. When
    a CRTC has no matching mode, it now disables the CRTC (instead of crashing).
    
    Also, poke the RandR extension when xf86SetSingleMode is done so that
    appropriate events can be delivered, and so that future RandR queries return
    correct information.

    called which could touch the hardware.

    When we see an evdev or vmmouse section, assume that it's a mouse, and
    don't add a default mouse device.  This will break users who have an
    evdev keyboard section but no mouse, and want the mouse to get added
    by default.

    RandR 1.1 clients expect the size fields in this event to be the unrotated
    dimensions of the screen.  This behavior is "weird", but that's the way the old
    code worked so we need to be bug-compatible with it.

    Split the xserver/fb/fbcmap.c file into two files.
    
    Now, fbcmap_mi.c contains the fb functions which just wrap mi functions.
    Previously, these were in fbcmap.c and compiled when XFree86Server was defined.
    Now, clients of fbcmap should either use fbcmap.c or fbcmap_mi.c and not worry
    about setting the XFree86Server symbol.

    It seems that the changes to X input exposed a problem that wasn't detected
    before.  The axis clipping code in GetPointerEvents() uses those limits to
    constrain the pointer's coordinate range.  The max was zero so the pointer
    couldn't move.

    Checkpoint DMX updates: things are working much better now, but still not 100% right.
    
    Use new dmxCoreMotion2() function which enqueues motion events with
    GetPointerEvents()/mieqEnqueue().
    The clipAxis() code in GetPointerEvents() is causing some grief.  The
    limits seem to have always been (0,0) according to the original calls
    to InitValuatorAxisStruct() in dmxinputinit.c.
    Terrible hack for now: Call InitValuatorAxisStruct() with hard-coded max
    values of 1280 (my screen width).

    Now, anything that needs libcw must explicitly initialize it, and
    miDisableCompositeWrapper (previously only called by EXA and presumably binary
    drivers) is gone.

    Make pending properties force mode set. And, remove AttachScreen calls.
    
    Yes, two changes in one commit. Sorry 'bout that.
    
    The first change ensures that when pending property values have been
    changed, a mode set to the current mode will actually do something, rather
    than being identified as a no-op. In addition, the driver no longer needs to
    manage the migration of pending to current values, that is handled both
    within the xf86 mode setting code (to deal with non-RandR changes) as well
    as within the RandR extension itself.
    
    The second change eliminates the two-call Create/AttachScreen stuff that was
    done in a failed attempt to create RandR resources before the screen
    structures were allocated. Merging these back into the Create function is
    cleaner.

    The DDC code sets the I2C timeouts to VESA standards, except that it had an

    Intel driver duplicated these settings, along with the error. Yay for cult

    Correct ref counting of RRMode structures
    
    RRModes are referenced by the resource db, RROutput and RRCrtc structures.
    Ensure that the mode reference count is decremented each time a reference is
    lost from one of these sources. The missing destroys were in
    RRCrtcDestroyResource and RROutputDestroyResource, which only happen at
    server reset time, so modes would be unavailable in subsequent server
    generations.

    Eliminate RRModeRec devPrivate field.
    
    The xf86 mode setting code was mis-using this field to try and store a
    pointer to a DisplayModeRec, however, each output has its own copy of every
    DisplayModeRec leaving the one in in the RRModeRec devPrivate field pointing
    at a random DisplayModeRec.
    
    Instead of attempting to rectify this, eliminating the devPrivate entirely
    turned out to be very easy; the DDX code now accepts an arbitrary RRModeRec
    structure and set that to the hardware, converting it on the fly to a
    DisplayModeRec as needed.

    mode list.

    into the general server code. Of course, the hope is that this code will be
    useful for other driver writers as well.
    
    Check out xf86Crtc.h for the usage information, making sure you add the
    needed hooks to the crtc funcs structure for your driver.

    physical size (if available). If that output has no physical size, just use
    96dpi as the default resolution and set the physical size as appropriate.

    Box transformation from source to dest area was broken, leaving the wrong

    When rotating from left to right, the pixmap doesn't get reallocated, and so

    the whole crtc area when this occurs to repaint the area.

    Add a canGrow argument to xf86InitialConfiguration.
    
    canGrow indicates to the DDX that the driver can enlarge the desktop via the
    xf86_config->funcs->resize hook.  If so, xf86InitialConfiguration will set
    virtual[XY] to match the configuration it chooses and will leave the crtc config
    size ranges alone.  If FALSE, it will bloat the screen to fit the largest probed
    mode and also set the crtc config max size to limit the desktop to the initial
    virtual[XY] size.

    Add a screen resize hook to xf86CrtcConfigRec.
    
    This hook is called when the DDX needs to resize the screen.  The driver is
    responsible for changing virtualX and virtualY, along with any other related
    screen properties (devPrivate.ptr, devKind, displayWidth, etc.).
    
    Use the size range from the crtc config instead of randrp->virtual[XY] when
    reporting the min and max screen sizes to the DDX.

commit 3344a4eda704edc7dc30037f095de277a60a70bb
Author: Michel Dänzer <michel@tungstengraphics.com>
Date:   Thu Feb 15 16:27:50 2007 +0100

    DRI: Make sure number of DRI windows is accurate in driver ClipNotify hook.
    
    Always call DRI{De,In}creaseNumberVisible (which in turn calls
    DRIDriverClipNotify) after updating pDRIPriv->nrWindows.

commit 3c7a27dc77595ad018bb7c4f7cef6bc178268cb6
Author: Michel Dänzer <michel@tungstengraphics.com>
Date:   Wed Feb 14 16:17:18 2007 +0100

    DRI: New ClipNotify driver hook.
    
    The hook is called whenever the clipList of any DRI window changes, be it via
    DRIClipNotify, DRICreateDrawable or DRIDrawablePrivDelete. This allows the
    driver to keep track of which DRI windows are visible where.

commit eedf148e5a1273ebbf4dc8dcac9c435712fc00ea
Author: Michel Dänzer <michel@tungstengraphics.com>
Date:   Fri Feb 2 18:27:40 2007 +0100

    Track number of visible DRI windows separately for transitions.
    
    This allows e.g. doing page flipping with multiple DRI windows as long as
    only one of them is visible.

    Check for clientGone before sending events from XFixes (bug #1753).
    
    Freeing resources during client closedown can cause cursor changes which
    attempt to send cursor events through the XFixes extension; a client in the
    process of closing down has no file to send events to, causing a crash when
    this path is hit.

    Don't set subpixel order during startup; the screen won't be ready.
    
    in xf86CrtcSetMode, scrn->pScreen will be NULL during server startup time,
    so don't try to set the subpixel order. subpixel order will be set in the
    randr initialization anyways.

    Ensure drivers can use new modes header files.
    
    New modes header files required a few minor changes to be used by external
    drivers, the most notable of which is the publication of the config file
    parser header files.

    Respect rotation in initial screen size computation.

commit e4507825bf0328ea59673f2bbe652de3a9105c86
Author: Keith Packard <keithp@guitar.keithp.com>
Date:   Fri Feb 16 00:41:29 2007 -0800

    Enable startup-time rotation; change rotation pixmap creation API.
    
    Add monitor "Rotate" option taking one of "normal", "left", "inverted" or
    "right". However, because initial mode selection is made before the screen
    is completely initialized, we cannot create the shadow pixmap object at this
    point. Pend the shadow pixmap creation until the block handler.
    
    Note that this code is not completely functional yet.

    Kludge around duplicate code added in hw/xfree86/modes.
    
    Code added in hw/xfree86/modes came from the server-1.3-branch.
    Portions of this code had previously been integrated into xf86Mode.c
    and edid_modes.c.
    
    To preserve hw/xfree86/modes as much as possible, the duplicate code from
    the other files has been disabled; a more careful review would figure out
    where that code actually belonged.

    Report correct RandR 1.0 sizeID. Report correct subpixel order.
    
    RandR 1.0 sizeID must be computed the same way every time, so when reporting
    it in the ScreenChangeNotify event, just construct the usual 1.0 data block
    and use that.
    
    subpixel geometry information can be computed by looking at the connected
    outputs and finding any with subpixel geometry and using one of those for
    the global screen subpixel geometry. This might be improved by reporting
    None if more than one screen has information and they conflict.

    Merge crtc/output-based mode selection code.
    
    This code comes from the intel driver, so there's no history in this tree.
    
    As the crtc/output-based mode selection code uses ddc, the ddc and i2c
    modules have been merged into the server. Attempts to load them are safely
    ignored now.

    Add an RDTSC implementation to the x86 emulator.
    
    This instruction is being used in some debug VBIOSes.  This implementation
    doesn't even try to be accurate.  Instead, it just increments the counter by a
    fixed amount every time an rdtsc instruction in encountered, to avoid divides by
    zero.

    Fix the size expectations of xRRSetCrtcGamma.
    
    It was using REQUEST_SIZE_MATCH (client request length must equal request size)
    rather than REQUEST_AT_LEAST_SIZE (client request length must be at least
    big enough for request size), and this request has data following the request
    structure.

    Set the Damage version supported in the server, instead of using damageproto.
    
    This was caught by distributions upgrading damageproto to 1.1, before the
    server they had supported it.  The server then advertised the new version
    without supporting the protocol.

    Bug #9680: Remove bogus blank length limiting in xf86SetModeCrtc().
    
    Our modes typically come from EDID or default modes, and when the monitor
    asks for a specific mode, deciding to tweak it usually results in incorrect
    display.  And if the user is specifying a mode by hand, tweaking it then is
    still pretty rude.

    Require glproto >= 1.4.8 for GLX.
    
    It builds against 1.4.7 as well, but it hardcodes the GLX_EXT_tfp tokens that
    were finalized in 1.4.8, so GLX_EXT_tfp breaks if the client side was built
    against an older glproto. This will hopefully alert people to rebuild other
    components (in particular Mesa) against the new glproto as well.

    Use RRScreenSetSizeRange in 1.0 compat. Check RRGetInfo for error.
    
    The RRScreenSizeSetRange function is used externally for 1.2 API drivers,
    but can also be used in the 1.0 compatibility code. This also ensures that
    the right changed bits are set so that clients are correctly notified when
    the range changes.
    
    RRGetInfo can return an error, use that to return BadAlloc to clients
    instead of blindly going on with various requests.

    fbdevhw: Consolidate modeset ioctl calling, report failure if it modifies mode.
    
    The fbdev API allows the driver to 'accept' modes it doesn't really support by
    modifying it to the nearest supported mode. Without this check, e.g. vesafb
    would appear to accept all modes, even though it actually can't set any modes
    other than the bootup mode at all.

    Switch the default migration heuristic for EXA to "always".
    
    This has been what has been used the most successfully post-damagetrack.
    The current thinking is that:
    1) We should be able to accelerate basically everything.  So we don't need to
       try to migrate trees of pixmaps permanently out of framebuffer to speed
       CPU drawing up.
    2) Migration is cheaper in the thrashing case, so we don't want to go to a lot
       of effort to try (and fail badly) to find a working set.

    Only do the _POSIX_C_SOURCE hackery on linux where it's required.
    
    On other OSes, the nasty hack was resulting in prototypes being hidden, so just
    don't do it.

    Add RRInit function to create resource types for RR objects.
    
    To allow RandR objects to be created before the screen object exists,
    the resource types must be registered with the resource database.
    A driver wishing to create RandR objects must call RRInit before doing so.
    
    Also, fix a segfault when setting Output data before it is associated with a
    screen.

    Allow RandR objects to be created before the associated ScreenRec.
    
    xf86 drivers need to create RandR object in the PreInit stage,
    before the ScreenRec is allocated. Changing the RandR DIX code
    to permit this required the addition of functions that later associate the
    objects with the related screen.
    
    An additional change is that modes are now global, and no longer associated
    with a specific screen. This change actually makes mode management cleaner
    as there is no more per-screen list of modes to deal with.
    
    This changes the RandR 1.2 ABI/API for drivers.

    XkbCopyKeymap: don't iterate broken types, or dereference null pointers
    
    Don't iterate invalid destination types (>= num_types) when coping key
    types.
    Don't free key_aliases if it's NULL (theoretical, but sure).
    Make sure dst's label_font gets allocated if it's NULL.
    (Thanks, Chris Lee.)

    Avoid dereferencing sprite.screen when Xinerama is not running. (#8925)
    
    With Xinerama support built into the X server but not in use,
    sprite.screen is NULL and yet the SyntheticMotion
    macro would dereference it. Avoid that by just passing sprite.screen
    to PostSyntheticMotion which can then dereference it when Xinerama is
    enabled.
    
    Also, define PostSyntheticMotion in dixevents.h and include dixevents.h in
    getevents.c

    Do not map full 0-1MB legacy range
    
    If we're mapping something in the "legacy range" (0-1Mb), we shouldn't
    expand the requested range to the entire 0-1Mb range.  Typically this
    is for mapping the VGA frame buffer, and some platforms support mmap of
    the frame buffer but not the entire 0-1Mb range.
    
    For example, HP sx1000 and sx2000 ia64 platforms can have memory from
    0-0x9ffff, VGA frame buffer from 0xa0000-0xbffff, and memory from
    0xc0000-0xfffff.  On these platforms, we can't map the entire 0-1Mb
    range with the same attribute because the memory only supports WB,
    while the frame buffer supports only UC.  But an mmap of just the
    frame buffer should work fine.

    Fixing mach64 driver bailing out on ia64
    
    Mach64 driver bails out on ia64 because it cannot map device
    memory. It turns out that some bogus and unneeded code attempts
    to find the root bridge of the device and fails to do so proberly
    as there this host-to-pci bridge is not existant. This code has
    been around for years although it completely unclear what it had
    been intended for. Fixing this by eliminating the bogus code.

    Don't bother trying to be smart in TimerSet, we'll pick it up in

    Compute virtual modmap size bounded by nVModMapKeys-1, rather than

    Forgot that all XKB requests took a device spec: the comparison of

    'if working on the core keyboard, does this device send core events; or,
    is this device the one we're working on?'.

    Just unref the connection instead of explicitly closing it (thanks, Rob
    McQueen).
    Add a commented-out unregister_object_path call: unfortunately, when we
    call it, libdbus segfaults.  But if we don't unregister the path, we
    can't register it again.  So regenerations are broken either way, but a
    little less violently like this.

    dix/devices: add devices in proper forward order
    Add devices in forward order with the normal linked list convention.
    Previously, AddInputDevice would add all the devices in reverse order to
    off_devices, before they were added again in reverse order to devices with
    EnableDevice.
    This just makes both work in forward order, which provides the ordering as
    you'd expect when hotplugging devices (i.e. adds them to the head, not the
    tail).

    mipointer: take device arguments, split miPointerAbsoluteCursor
    Update mipointer API to take a device argument to (almost) all functions,
    and split miPointerAbsoluteCursor into a couple of separate functions.
    Remove miPointerAbsoluteCursor call from mieq, as we now deal with it in
    GetPointerEvents.
    Make miPointerSetPosition (successor of miPointerAbsoluteCursor) take
    pointers to x and y, so it can return the clipped values.
    Modify callers of miPointer*() functions to generally use the new
    functions.
    This should fix things with multi-head setups.

    Steal Xinerama code from SiS driver. Add missing files.
    
    Provide a Xinerama implementation when DIX version isn't enabled. This
    version exposes each crtc as a separate 'screen' and reports the size of
    that patch. The extension also sends ConfigureNotify events to the root
    window whenever crtcs change so that applications will re-fetch xinerama
    information. This actually works for metacity.

    Always believe the monitor when it reports a reduced-blanking mode.
    
    CVT reduced blanking modes are typically only seen on digital connections to
    LCDs, but there are some monitors that report them as supported over the
    VGA connector too, which is perfectly legitimate, electrically speaking.

    In xf86MatchPciInstances, fail gracefully when there's no PCI device at all.
    
    This allows the autoconfig logic to fall through sanely on non-PCI machines,
    which importantly includes Xen virtual machines.

    Prefer driver-provided modes when matching name strings to modelines.
    
    Well, kinda.  Strictly we prefer M_T_BUILTIN strongest since those are modes
    where the driver has said it absolutely can't do anything else (VBE).  Then
    we look for user-defined modes, ie, modelines from the config file.  Then
    we consider modes reported by the monitor via EDID.  Finally if nothing has
    matched yet we consider the default mode pool.
    
    Within each of the above-mentioned classes, modes with the M_T_PREFERRED bit
    take priority over other modes in the same class.
    
    This logic ensures that the timings sent to the monitor exactly match the
    timings it reported as supported, which occasionally don't match the numbers
    you might get for that mode from CVT or GTF.

    Mark EDID modes as driver modes.  Infer virtual size from driver modes.
    
    This allows the server to guess an appropriate initial virtual size and
    resolution.  The heuristic is to select the largest driver-reported mode
    that matches the monitor's physical aspect ratio.  We revalidate this
    estimate after mode validation, since we may have filtered away all
    modes that would fill that size.
    
    Also, the EDID preferred timing is now marked as M_T_PREFERRED as well.

    Attempt to add the 'mouse' driver in more situations.
    
    Always add a mouse driver instance configured to send core events, unless
    a core pointer already exists using either the mouse or void drivers.  This
    handles the laptop case where the config file only specifies, say,
    synaptics, which causes the touchpad to work but not the pointing stick.
    We don't double-instantiate the mouse driver to avoid the mouse moving twice
    as fast, and we skip this logic when the user asked for a void core pointer
    since that probably means they want to run with no pointer at all.

    Fix up EDID blocks where the max pixclock exceeds the preferred mode clock.
    
    Base EDID only lets you specify the maximum dotclock in tens of MHz, which
    is too fuzzy for some monitors.  1600x1200@60 is just over 160MHz, but if
    the monitor really can't handle any mode at 170MHz, then 160 is more
    correct.  Fix up the EDID block before the driver can see it in this case,
    so we don't spuriously reject modes.

    Fix problems with vertex program protocol
    
    There were two sets of bugs in the vertex program (ARB and NV)
    protocol.  First, several of the ARB functions were missing the
    'doubles_in_order="true"' annotation.  Second, after the ARB decided
    that glVertexAttrib*ARB functions must not alias fixed-function state
    for GLSL, Nvidia re-assigned GLX protocol opcodes for
    glVertexAttrib*NV (circa Septeber 2004).  For some reason gl_API.xml
    was never updated to reflect this, and the updated version of the
    GL_NV_vertex_program spec never made into the registry.
    
    This is just a server-side regeneration from gl_API.xml version 1.68.

    (resp DRIDoWakeupHandler) directly. They are now calling DRIBlockHandler
    (resp DRIWakeupHandler) to account for driver specific block/wakeup
    hooks.

    require the current version (1.0.2).

    an AlphaMap to a source picture will fail with BadMatch just like a Window
    would, preventing another crash.

    Bug #7381: Coordinates get wrapped in accelerated line drawing on pixmap
    
    XAAPolylinesWideSolid was adding the drawable origin onto each element in the
    pPts array.  Since the values got stored back into the pPts array, they got
    truncated to 16 bits, causing the overflow I saw.  This patch avoids storing
    the coords back into the pPts array (and actually reduces the size of the
    code too :).  Now the 32-bit sum of coords + origin doesn't get truncated to
    16 bits, and the problem is solved.

    Another round of loader sense-beating.  Remove the (unused) server export

    the built server on x86.

    don't appear to cause any harm.  You would think this would be automatic...

    expected it to get re-validated, and we didn't because the wrapped drawable
    hadn't been bumped.

    Add Polylines and PolyPoint acceleration as well. This is primarily to
        clean up fallback debugging output, so I can focus on more imporant
        cases. Performance is comparable but without hardware stalls, and

    Improve EXA fallback debugging output to include the locations of pixmaps.
        This is being used in tracking down recent compositing performance
        regressions.

Author: Eric Anholt <anholt@freebsd.org>
Date:   Thu Apr 27 19:17:34 2006 +0000

    Add trivial PolySegment acceleration for 0-width horizontal/vertical lines,
        which still happen somewhat frequently and were cluttering up my
        fallback debugging output. x11perf says it's a major performance win in
        those cases (though probably irrelevant), and it passes Xlib9.

    In drawing glyphs, shortcut our way to exaComposite instead of going
        through the whole CompositePicture stack and doing things like
        computing damage over again. This is a sizeable win for text drawing
        with a compmgr. Also avoid calling down into the server for dealing
        with the scratch pixmap when we are able to do UploadToScreen
        successfully and never need it.

    Add a helper for the Component Alpha Over case, which breaks the operation
        down into an OutReverse and an Add. Turn off the fallback to software
        glyphs when component alpha, now that we expect all (new) drivers to be
        able to support it. Also, make Xephyr fall back in the CA Over case to
        exercise this code. This speeds up my rgb24text and ls -lR in
        gnome-terminal by a factor of 5.

    Fix a bug in the intersection computation that could concievably cause
        incorrect results to be returned (but would probably usually be
        over-conservative).

    Bug #4668: Check if the lists of glyphs don't have any intersecting glyphs,
        and if they all have a maskFormat matching the format of the actual
        glyphs If so, we can avoid the temporary pixmap for accumulating
        glyphs, which reduces the number of operations done, and makes it
        easier on the migration system. This fixes some significant performance
        issues, particularly with subpixel antialiasing. Note that it does
        increase the amount of damage computation which is done, so is not
        always a win with a compositing manager running.

    Add an option to verify at the point of migration that pixmaps which aren't

    Missed in previous commit: Add a new migration scheme, called "Smart" for
        lack of a better name. This one behaves somewhat between Greedy and
        Always. It moves in if we can accelerate, unless the destination is
        clean and shouldn't be kept in framebuffer according to the score, in
        which case we migrate out (and force-migrate anything where migration
        is free). This should help fix lack of acceleration for drivers without
        UTS since removing exaAsyncPixmapGCOps, and has removed one performance
        trap with Radeon I'd noticed. It is the new default.

    Bump the ABI versions. Due to Glyph privates and the XV update below, the
        video driver ABI needs to be bumped to 1.0. The rest of the ABI minor
        versions were bumped to include the LoaderGetABIVersion function.
    Add a DrawblePtr argument to the XV hooks. This allows drivers to determine
        that the target window is redirected and draw to the appropriate place.

    Add an option to EXA for the DDX to request that EXA hide the pixmap's
        devPrivate.ptr when pointing at offscreen memory, outside of
        exaPrepare/FinishAccess(). This was used with fakexa to find (by NULL
        dereference) many instances of un-Prepared CPU access to the
        framebuffer:
    - GC tiles used in several ops when fillStyle == FillTiled were never
        Prepared.
    - Migration could lead to un-Prepared access to mask data in render's
        Trapezoids and Triangles
    - PutImage's UploadToScreen failure fallback failed to Prepare.

    Remove the exaAsyncPixmapGCOps mostly-unaccelerated ops vector, and always
        plug in the accelerated one, even if the destination pixmap is
        currently offscreen. This was a leftover from when kaa originally got
        accelerated offscreen pixmap support, and its only concievable use was
        to avoid a little overhead on ops to in-system pixmaps that weren't
        going to get migrated. At this point, we probably care more about just
        getting everything accelerated that we easily can, which should happen
        with the new migration support.

    Mark the ARGB FBConfig as nonconforming to prevent drivers and apps from
        falling over.
    Add @GLX_DEFINES@ so GLcore gets compiled with TLS support if configured.
    Only destroy the mesa buffer if it got initialized.

    Added notice to last ChangeLog entry
    Fixes for some vsw4 failures on 64bit BE platforms such as PPC64 and s390x.
        Provided by Hong Bo Peng of IBM (slightly modified). Patches try to
        resolve some of the careless mixtures of ulong and uint (which are
        different size on
    64bit). > This patch will break the driver ABI! < Bugzilla #6438.

    Bug #2986: Add PutImage acceleration for the ZPixmap, planeMask ~=
        FB_ALLONES, bitsPerPixel >= 8, GXcopy cases. With the radeon driver on
        my machine, this gives about 10% speedup in PutImage
    10x10 and 500x500, and 40% speedup for 10x10 ShmPutImage, up to 65%
        improvement in 500x500 ShmPutImage. Also fixes a crasher in GetImage
        that slipped in at the last minute.

    Add an UploadToScreen implementation, for testing PutImage support, and
        make the DownloadFromScreen more robust.

    Bug #2986: Add acceleration of GetImage using DownloadFromScreen for the
        ZPixmap, planeMask ~= FB_ALLONES, bitsPerPixel >= 8 case. I'm pretty
        convinced that this is the only case that we care about at all. Tested
        with xwd -root and xwd on a gnome-terminal, in a composited environment
        or not.

commit 4bb5ab0b4453208573b91b334940f190a8f7210a
Author: Eric Anholt <anholt@freebsd.org>
Date:   Wed Mar 29 22:03:18 2006 +0000

    Add a DownloadFromScreen implementation, used for testing GetImage
        acceleration, and set the migration scheme to Always on init (since
        this is all for testing, and Always should make migration happen more
        frequently than Greedy).

    Change EXA so that exaMoveOutPixmap() retains the framebuffer copy of the
        pixmap, and damage is tracked so that a later exaMoveInPixmap won't
        result in an upload if no upload is necessary. This will likely improve
        the performance of the "Always" migration scheme significantly, and is
        a step in the path to more exact damage tracking between framebuffer
        and system memory.

    Fix DRIExtensionInit() to not register callbacks when it hasn't been
        initialized for the current server generation. Fixes a problem where it
        would use stale private index and blow up in colorful ways if no driver
        called DRIScreenInit() on the second generation (which happens due to a
        bug in radeon that i'll fix separately). Note: clearing the index in
        DRIReset() wouldn't work as DRIReset() is called before the
        CloseScreen() chain

        desired location always (unless they don't fit in FB, in which case
        they all get moved out for software rendering). The default remains as
        before, but can be controlled by the MigrationHeuristic xorg.conf
        option (which is intentionally not documented, as it may be
        short-lived). This is part of the exa-damagetrack work, which appears
        stable in testing with fakexa, unlike the work as a whole.

Date:   Tue Mar 14 21:30:12 2006 +0000

    Move migration logic to a new function, exaDoMigration(). This is largely a
        manual conversion to allow for different migration schemes to be
        implemented reasonably, but does include some minor improvements such
        as accounting for pinned pixmaps not being acceleratable, and for our
        current GetImage and GetSpans not being accelerated.

    If fakexa is enabled, create a larger buffer in the Ximage, but keep the
        same width/height for front-buffer drawing. The fakexa code then uses
        this extra space for offscreen pixmaps. Note that this tones down the
        absurdity of fakexa's offscreen pixmap alignment requirements (odd
        alignment is too weird, so stick with "24", which is still strange but
        exists out there). It also fixes a couple of bugs in the fakexa
        implementation revealed by using offscreen pixmaps.

    Move the exaDrawableDirty in exaPrepareAccess to exaFinishAccess, which is
        after the drawing is done. Previously, a failed PrepareAccess could
        have migrated and cleared the dirty flag before the damage was ever
        done.

    Rearrange EXA driver structures so that there's a hope of maintaining ABI
        when extending the driver interface. The card and accel structures are
        merged into the ExaDriverRec, which is to be allocated using
        exaDriverAlloc(). The driver structure also grows exa_major and
        exa_minor, which drivers fill in and have checked by EXA
        (double-checking that the driver really did check that the EXA version
        was correct). Removes exaInitCard(), which is replaced by the driver
        filling in the rec by hand, and the exaGetVersion() and related
        EXA_*VERSION which are replaced by always using the XFree86 loadable
        module versioning.

    render/picture.c Initialize the format of a source picture to
        PICT_a8r8g8b8. Fixes a failure in the gradients test of rendercheck. In
        the long term we could do better by setting the format to something
        without alpha whenever the gradient doesn't contain colors with alpha.
        This triggers a reduction of the over operation to a pure source
        operation.

Date:   Tue Mar 7 19:57:46 2006 +0000

    Add a new flag to ephyr, "-fakexa", which turns on an EXA acceleration
        implementation that calls fb to get its work done. The purpose is to
        have a trusted EXA driver for use with testing changes to the core of
        EXA. However, fakexa has not received much testing yet, lacks offscreen
        pixmaps support, and doesn't reliably provide garbage when EXA doesn't
        get its syncing right. All of these should be fixed soon.

commit cfdacab33a62b47f22bb54683e3ca20ec9824864
Author: Ian Romanick <idr@us.ibm.com>
Date:   Tue Feb 21 00:02:08 2006 +0000

    Eliminate unused PCI BIOS reading functionality. The old code used several
        function pointers to implement a level of flexability that was never
        used. The code also had unused support for extracting a single image
        type from a larger expansion ROM.
    Fix the spelling of PCI_BIOS_OPEN_FIRMWARE.
    Fix a couple errors in #ifdef debug code.
    These changes have been tested on x86 and x86-64 Linux.

Date:   Mon Feb 20 23:45:50 2006 +0000

    Eliminate all the code for querying the PCI class from the PCI ID database.
        Class information is not, and never has been, stored there. Therefore,
        this is just a bunch of elaborate code to read 0x00000000.
    This has received testing on x86 and x86-64 Linux.

    Fix an occasional crash on VT switches: the server would save a pointer to
        the current cursor when disabling FB access and would try to restore
        that cursor when re-enabling. However, that cursor might have been
        destroyed in between. This fixes it by updating the saved cursor
        pointer when a cursor is set and vtSema is FALSE.

    Move EXA implementation up to the top level and remove its XFree86
        dependencies. It was nearly abstract enough already to be used by
        multiple DDXes. This will be useful for EXA development through
        providing a fake acceleration implementation within Xephyr, so that
        testing can be done on new EXA code without worrying about buggy
        drivers.

    DRIGetSecs() would call getsecs() when XFree86LOADER is defined, relying on
        the wrappers to provide it. Wrapper gone, and getsecs doesn't exist on

        all cases instead.

    Only try to use byteswap.h on linux. Assume that everyone else (thinking of
        BSDs here) has sys/endian.h, and use macros as appropriate for the
        names. This should probably be in a gloabl header.

    More kdrive merge, fast path fbBlt to use memcpy() when possible. Good for
        -5% to 60% speedup on XGetImage, and 0% to 10% speedup on copies within

    Bug #2996: libglx / libGLcore should use a dispatch table
    Port all changes from the (monolithic) accelerated_indirect-0-0-1 branch to
        the modular trunk. This will break the Darwin and cygwin builds. Other
        than the changes to symlink-mesa.sh and the various Makefile.am files,
        to code is identical to what's in the branch.

        screen size (display mode). Useful for faked widescreen modes, modes
        which are scaled by the driver, etc. This really helps fixing RandR's
        sometimes dumb DPI assumptions.

    Add an additional meaning to the "dirty" flag. Now, if !dirty && !area, the
        pixmaps's contents are undefined, so we won't need to upload the
        undefined contents in MoveIn. Use the ExaCheck* for async ops as well,
        so that dirty is always tracked. While the performance impact for my ls
        -lR test was not significant (though the avoiding-upload path was being
        hit), it's likely to be important for the upcoming Get/PutImage
        acceleration from ajax.

    Remove an RM line that appears unnecessary and was breaking the build at
        xf86DefModeSet.c with FreeBSD make, where RM was undefined. While here,
        make the build of xf86DefModeSet.c depend on its sources, so it'll
        rebuild properly, and make it a normal CLEANFILE rather than a
        DISTCLEANFILE, since the intention seems to be to build it at the
        user's build time.

    Fix a couple of bugs in the offscreen allocator. One mostly harmless was
        causing our search loop for evictable blocks to possibly skip a good
        candiate, and another was the allocator would occasionally use
        area->offset as if it was the base of the pixmap, while for a pixmap
        that is not in available state, it is not. This caused some funny
        miscalculation leading to overlapping pixmaps and accesses beyond the
        end of the framebuffer. To make things cleared, I renamed save_offset
        to base_offset, made sure it's the one used everywhere in the
        allocator, and only align "offset" for the client at the end of
        exaOffscreenAlloc().

    Don't try the accelerated glyphs path for component-alpha text (which I
        don't expect drivers to be able to accelerate without exa assistance).
        Instead, drop back to plain old miGlyphs for a 62.5% +/- 1.5% reduction
        in runtime of my ls -lR test (n=5) with component alpha. While a
        reasonable approach would seem to be making a better test to see
        whether the entire path would be accelerated and force migration
        appropriately, my attempt at this made the situation much worse.

    Clients tend to set picture->repeat when not necessary. Most HW cannot
        accelerate repeat NPOT thus triggering software fallback (this is the
        case with gnome desktop for example). This adds a simple optimisation
        to exa that removes "repeat" when it's obviously useless, that is, the
        single picture instance covers the entire rectangle beeing used

    Mark the temporary pixmap dirty if UploadToScreen succeeds. Failure to do
        so resulted in a solid black glyph if the font rendering actually
        resulted in a fallback (subpixel AA, for example) and the temporary got
        migrated after 10 or so glyphs.

    Bugzilla #4616:
    - Merge various fb/ bits of COMPOSITE support from xserver, which weren't
        necessary before due to cw hiding the issues. Fixes offset calculations
        for a number of operations, and may pull some fixes that cairo has
        wanted for XAA as well.
    - Add a new call, miDisableCompositeWrapper(), which a DDX can call to keep
        cw from getting initialized from the damage code. While it would be
        cleaner to have each DDX initialize it if it needs it, we don't have
        control over all of them (e.g. nvidia).
    - Use the miDisableCompositeWrapper() to keep cw from getting set up for
        screens using EXA, because EXA is already aware of composite. Avoiding
        cw improved performance 0-35% on operations tested by ajax in x11perf.

commit 2c82429f8957ed0268c0e4e4fe5aed9093f33960
Author: Ian Romanick <idr@us.ibm.com>
Date:   Sat Oct 1 22:25:13 2005 +0000

    Refactors __glXImageSize and __glXImage3DSize into a single function. It
        replaces all calls to the old functions with calls to __glXImageSize
        with the new parameter list.
    I have also added 'target' as a parameter. This is a stepping stone to the
        code in patch #2410. Basically, if the texture target is one of
        GL_PROXY_*, the image size is always zero. This gathers all the checks
        for that into a single place. I have *not* modified the existing
        callers to take this into account. They still do their own checks for
        GL_PROXY_*. However, when the generated versions of those functions are
        added to the tree, they *will* rely on that.
    The code growth is mainly due to the new 40 line comment before
        __glXImageSize.
    I have tested this with a few of the texture using demos and tests from
        Mesa, including tunnel, texdown, and drawpix.

    - Change migration-in rule slightly: previously, if your score was less
        than the max, it was bumped, and then if you were above the threshhold
        you got moved in. Instead, do the above-threshhold check separate from
        score starting out less than max. While this will likely make thrashing
        cases worse, I hope it will fix some issues with long term performance
        (think of an xcompmgr with a backbuffer it's doing only accelerated
        operations to. If some new pixmap comes in and bumps it out, even once,
        it will never get a chance to re-migrate because its score will be
        maxed). Change migration-out to be the same way for symmetry, though it
        shouldn't ever affect anything.
    - Fix a lot of debugging output, both in terms of printing quality, and
        completeness. The fallback debugging covers a lot more now, pointing
        out new areas for improvement. Debugging toggles are now centralized in
        exaPriv.h.

    Add support for hardware accelerating tiled background painting. One
        example of this is the root weave, which paints slightly slower on SiS
        now in my testing. However, according to keithp some apps use this
        feature for a sort of cheap backing store, which this could help with
        significantly. While I haven't done much performance testing with it,
        it will at least rule out one possible source of terrible performance.

    Break EXA ABI while we still can. Add coordinates to the UploadToScreen
        hook so we can upload a subset of a pixmap, and convert the current
        drivers to respect that. Use this support to directly UploadToScreen in
        exaGlyphs, providing a 47.4% +/-2.4% decrease in wall time for ls -lR
        programs/Xserver in an antialiased gnome-terminal on an M6 (n=3, caches
        hot). I would have bumped major version, only I can't tell what the
        EXA_VERSION_* is supposed to be doing as opposed to the module version.

    - Don't try to upload 0 byte-per-pixel (PICT_a1) data using
        RADEONHostDataBlit.
    - Disable the shortcut for switching from 3d to 3d in radeon_exa.c. It
        appears that we do need the cache flush here, thought it's not clear
        why. Disable the 2d to 2d shortcut while here, since I'm unsure of what
        we're doing. Exposed by the following bit:
    - Bug #4485: Add a new routine, exaGlyphs, to handle font drawing. Glyphs
        were being accumulated in from non-migratable scratch pixmaps, causing
        the destination pixmap to move towards screen but the migration
        necessary for source never to happen, leading to abysmal performance.
        Instead, copy the scratch glyph data into a real pixmap first, then
        composite from that into the destination, allowing for migration. time
        ls -lR from programs/Xserver showed 26.9% (+/- 6.3%) decrease in wall
        time (n=3).
    - Create exaDrawableUse* wrapping exaPixmapUse*, but which are aware of
        windows needing backing store. Makes migration code prettier, and
        ensures that composited windows will be migrated as normal when we turn
        off cw for EXA. (issue brought up by keithp)

        out to framebuffer if insufficient swappers are available (note: must

    Remove existing broken maxX/maxY code for composite (results in infinite

        to software when coordinate limits could be violated. Act similarly in
        other acceleration cases as well.
    The solution I want to see (and intend to do soon) is to (when necessary)
        create temporary pictures/pixmaps pointing towards the real ones' bits,
        with the offsets adjusted, then render from/to those using adjusted
        coordinates.

        WindowHasNewCursor().

    Bugzilla #4226: Change the pixmap migration strategy for the CopyNtoN case.
        Now, if either source or dest were in framebuffer, try to get both
        there, but prefer system memory for both otherwise. Required making
        exaasync.c go through the try-acceleration path. This significantly
        improves window resizing under composite, because previously the
        pattern of creating a new pixmap and copying default contents from the
        screen caused a fallback every time due to the new destination pixmap
        being in system memory.

    Huge cleanup. Group into sections: hardware feature detection, extension
        detection/configuration, DDX options. Make building of Xorg DDX fully
        optional. Clarify and correct some help texts. Change all comments to
        use dnl instead of #. Quote all tests correctly, and guard
        pure-variable tests with 'x' (e.g. test $DMX = yes -> test "x$DMX" =
        xyes). Since the DDXes seem to have pretty divergent extension support
        these days, get rid of EXTENSION_LIBS, DMX_EXTENSIONS and
        XPRINT_EXTENSIONS, and go back to building extension lists by hand in
        the DDX-specific sections. Use portable POSIX constructs everywhere
        (e.g. test foo && test bar, instead of test foo -a bar).
    Clean up old cruft.
    Set _XSERVER64 on 64-bit architectures, and use x86_64 for host_cpu instead
        of amd64 (Jürg Billeter).

    Use '$(DRMSRCDIR)/shared-core' instead of '$(DRMSRCDIR)/shared' for DRM
        includes. This matches the way drivers are built in the Mesa tree and
        fixes a build problem in the Savage driver.
    Convert uses of __glPointParameterfvARB_size to
        __glPointParameterfvEXT_size and uses of __glPointParameteriv_size to
        __glPointParameterivNV_size. This eliminates the need to hand-edit
        indirect_size.c after it is generated.

    Need to define SVR4 on SVR4-ish systems since many headers and source files
        check for it, expecting Imake to have defined it already. (Should be
        replaced with more specific checks & defines, but there's too many to
        get them all right now.)

    Change the default depth back to 8 like it was originally. Disable the
        addition of depth 12 & 30. It causes more than MAXFORMATS depths to be

        <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/attachment.cgi?id=3058>
    08-Jul-2005 nv driver updates from Mark Vojkovich:
    Change some console restore code for NV11. Hopefully, we can more reliably
        restore the console for desktop systems using DVI. This may correct a
        recent regression on NV11.
    Also, new PCI IDs.
    Add new nVidia PCI ids to match nv_driver.c changes.

    Greatly improve the correctness and performance of the MGA render
        implementation. Includes cache flushing to prevent bad first reads of
        the framebuffer, fixing blending of many formats, falling back on many
        unsupported operations, and falling back early to prevent migration.
        Passes all of rendercheck except some of the blend (!) tests.

    TSLib fixes. Add fullscreen support to ephyr

commit 545c082cf9c86f2a809ea6b4dca33643afb0c3d3
Author: Eric Anholt <anholt@freebsd.org>
Date:   Thu Jun 9 10:44:45 2005 +0000

    - Replace the syncAccel hook in the kdrive structure with a pair of hooks
        in the kaa structure: markSync and waitMarker. The first, if set,
        returns a hardware-dependent marker number which can then be waited for
        with waitMarker. If markSync is absent (which is the case on all
        drivers currently), waitMarker must wait for idle on any given marker
        number. The intention is to allow for more parallelism when we get
        downloading from framebuffer, or more fine-grained idling.
    - Replace the KdMarkSync/KdCheckSync functions with kaaMarkSync and
        kaaWaitSync. These will need to be refined when KAA starts being smart
        about using them. Merge kpict.c into kasync.c since kasyn.c has all the
        rest of these fallback funcs.
    - Restructure all drivers to initialize a KaaInfo structure by hand rather
        than statically in dubious order.
    - Whack the i810 driver into shape in hopes that it'll work after this
        change (it certainly wouldn't have before this). Doesn't support my
        i845 though.
    - Make a new KXV helper to avoid duplicated code to fill the region with
        the necessary color key. Use it in i810 and mach64 (tested).

    VBESetVBEMode() calls int10 0x4f02 to set a VBE video mode. This can be a
        standard mode solely determined by the mode ID or it may be a detailed
        mode with almost arbitrary mode parameters. The mode parameters are
        passed to the BIOS in a memory area pointed to by es:di. If bit 11 in
        the video mode is set this memory area is evaluated. When we don't have
        such an area (passed to VBESetVBEMode() this function should unset this
        bit for sanity reasons. (Bugzilla #3329)

    Avoid segfaults if the number of user supplied monitor ranges exceed the
        number of preallocated slots. We should really make this dynamic - but
        I don't think this ever caused a problem so it's more or less academic.
    A. Avoid that *SyncStart starts before *BlankStart. If *BlankStart >
    *SyncStart it is made = *SyncStart and its width is made maximal but such
        that the blank does not exceed *Total. Since the Sync width has the
        same restrictions as the Blank width monitors should still be able to
        clamp after the sync pulse. B. Over time mode validation has become
        inconsistent when people started to add additional features to the mode
        validation. One such feature is that the mode->Crtc* values have been
        (ab)used to allow the driver ValidMode() function to pass driver
        normalized timing values back to the validation function. The
        introduction of these features made the code less readable and created
        numerous possibly unintended side effects in the validation semantics.
        I've attempted to consolidate these changes making the code more
        consistent and eliminating a number of side effects. This should not
        cause problems for the majority of drivers, still it should receive
        testing - especially with ATi Mach64 and Radeon code. (Bugzilla #3325).

    Don't fail calling function when DriverFunc() for RandR fails as
        DriverFunc() also returns FALSE when the specific sub function isn't
        supported. In the case of xf86RandRGetInfo() we simply rely on what has
        been set before and return TRUE. In the case of xf86RandRSetConfig() we
        only bail with FALSE if we have to do a rotation and the call fails. We
        presently cannot do rotation on the fly without the help of a driver
        function (Bugzilla #2745).

        which mostly involve the modifications to make the RRFunc (introduced
        with 6.8) more flexible please check Bugzilla #2407. NOTE: This patch
        applies changes to OS specific files for other OSes which I cannot

    Add an OUT_RING_REG macro for use with DMA_PACKET0, which is like OUT_RING
        but includes debugging to ensure that the reg being submitted is the
        one that follows in the packet. Convert most uses of OUT_RING to it,
        and convert a couple of OUT_REG sets to DMA_PACKET0/OUT_RING_REG. Also,
        add checking to see if more registers are submitted to a DMA_PACKET0
        than should be, to avoid hangs during stupid mistakes (checking for
        less isn't done).

    When we tested if a PCI base address was unassigned we didn't take into
        account that this bar could have been the upper part of a 64bit base
        address. This fix makes this code 64bit bar aware (Bugzilla #2382).

    Rewrite of RemoveOverlaps() to make the code more readable. It was
        virtually impossible to determine if the old code did what it was

    Add a set of macros for dealing with the repeated code to wait for a while
        reading a register/attempting DMA. Now it'll wait for a certain number
        of seconds rather than a certain number of times through the loop
        before deciding that it's timed out and resetting the hardware. Also,
        add more timeout handling, and reset the draw state after resetting the
        engine.

    Let the OS instead of X save/restore text console fonts on Linux. So far we
        relied on the generic VGA layer to restore text console fonts for us
        when shutting down the server or VT switching back to the text console.
        This has worked rather well but it has some downsides on Linux: a. Many
        people use fbdev as console text mode. In this case it is not necessary
        to save/restore console fonts as the console is running in graphics
        mode anyway. b. Some architectures don't have a fbdev console but
        require a full POST of even the primary card (ie. IA64). This posting
        has to take place before we even have a chance to save anything.
        Therefore the fonts we save are the once written to the chip by POST,
        not what has been programmed by the user. c. Certain chipsets utilize
        the BIOS to perform mode setting. This may interfer with the vga
        save/restore font function in a strange way. It would therefore be
        preferrable to let the OS - which has been used to set up the font in
        the first place - take care of saving/restoring the data. I will attach
        a patch which will do so for Linux. To make this fully functional a
        small patch needs to be applied to the Linux kernel. To disable this
        feature add: #define DoOSFontRestore NO to your host.def. (Bugzilla
        #2277)

    Back out the previous day's broken R200 "fix" -- the same number of coords
        are always emitted. Fix the real problem, which was not enough regs
        being initialized in ati_draw.c. Fix a typo that was resulting in alpha
        coming out as 0 * src or 0 * broken instead of src * 1 or src * mask.
        Assign the blending results to R0, as appears to be necessary. Unbreak
        the dst-alpha-blend-with-no-dst-alpha code. Yow. And set the right DMA
        count for the r200 traps code.

    Make Xorg the default server to install.
    Avoid PIO access on IA64. Some IA64 machine check if legacy ports outside
        the VGA range are accessed. The ATi driver however does this to probe
        for ISA Mach8/32/64. Since no IA64 has ISA slots this restriction
        should not be relevant to the user.
    Avoid recursive calls of xf86scanpci(). This function normally detects that
        it has been called before by checking if the PCI structure is filled
        out. So far if this was not the case (because PCI probing has failed
        for some reason) the function is traversed again. With the chipset
        specific PCI bus probing this can lead to an endless recursive loop as
        the post-probing code calls xf86scanpci() from within this function.
    The OS specific PCI code for Linux worked only if bus 0 was populated as it
        checked for the presence of /proc/bus/pci/00. Fixed to check for
        /proc/bus/pci/<bus_to_look_for> instead.

    Fix for https://freedesktop.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1664 - RFE: Add
        support for the DOUBLE-BUFFER extension to the Xprint server and DDX.
        Additionally a "pixmap-scrubber" optimisation is added to the
        PostScript DDX to remove all content from a vector pixmap when a
        |PolyFillRect()| call covers the whole pixmap surface with a solid fill
        (this avoids that a backbuffer vector pixmap gets constantly filled
        even when the content is not visible anymore after |XdbeSwapBuffers()|
        has cleared the hidden buffer with the background color).

    Made handling of DevelDrivers for x86-64 more conformant to other
        platforms.
    Compress all font encodings (Stefan Dirsch).
    Fixed warnings.
    Turn on forwarding XNSpotLocation event to XIM server in OffTheSpot and
        Root mode (bugzilla #1580, James Su).
    Added another compose key combination for the Euro symbol (Stefan Dirsch).
    Added support for UTF-8 in ja_JP, ko_KR and zh_TW locales (Mike Fabian).
    Changed default encoding for ru from KOI8-R to ISO8859-5 (Mike Fabian).
        This is the encoding that is also used by glibc. We may break other
        libcs - lets see who complains.
    Added explanation for DESTDIR to install to a different directory than /.
    Added some early bailouts to atiprobe if PCI structure pointer is NULL to
        prevent sig11.
    XV support doesn't depend on 2D acceleration any more. This patch removes
        this limitation from the NSC driver. This is a patch that I have
        committed to XFree86 a while ago but never ported over to X.Org.
        Matthieu Herrb contributed some build fixes.
    Fixing SetDPMSTimers() so that DPMS*Time == 0 disables the appropriate
        timer. This takes advantage of the fact that TimerSet() with a timeout
        argument 0 behaves like TimerCanel().
    Use /dev/xconsole (named pipe) or devpts for system logger (Werner Fink).
    Create missing links for backward compatibility to XFree86 (Stefan Dirsch).
    Changed comment to mention xorg.
    Changed cursor for the 'kill' action from XC_draped_box to XC_Pirate. If
        you don't like it we can change it back (original author unkown).
    Added 'pic' to the man page rendering command pipeline (Werner Fink).
    Added missing return value (Stefan Dirsch, Roland Mainz)

    Set fbdev mode as the default mode on PPC (Olaf Hering).
    Added support for IBM space saver keyboard (Stefan Dirsch). Added support
        for Cherry CyMotion Master XPress (Marcus Schaefer).
    Change order of SetDisplayDevice(), HWRestore(), UnbindGART() and
        RestoreBIOSMemSize() to be exactly opposite to the Save procedure in
        EnterVT() (Matthias Hopf, Alan Hourihane).
    Fix text mode restauration by removing the assumption that the register
        which determines which head is programmed is set. to the active head by
        the BIOS (Mark Vojkovich).
    When I wrote the resource code 5 years ago I made some assumptions which
        turned out to be false: I've assumed that the bus number of the PCI
        hostbridge would be the PCI bus the bridge links to. This is not
        correct. Fixing this assumption is not easy. However I hope that the
        attached patch will make the system work regardless as it 'ignores'
        host bridges from which the target bus is not known. This should not
        matter at all as we really don't care about host bridges (unless we
        have bridge specific code which retrieves information about the
        bridge).
    Fixed server crash on reset when a structure allocated in PreInit() was
        freed on CloseScreen().
    Fixed ring buffer lock ups that happened because the structure that
        contained ringbuffer data was not zeroed after allocation.
    Fixed numerous warnings due to signed unsigned comparisons.
        programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/drivers/nv/nv_driver.c:
        (NVBacklightEnable): Changed the order in which the sequencer registers
        and the backlight control registers are written. The sequencer control
        register need to be written first otherwise DPMS screen blanking
        produces vertical bars on a mobile device. lib/Xau/Imakefile: Build
        libXau static library PIC so it can be linked into toolkits that would
        like to wrap its functionality.

    Unblank secondary screen explicitely. Don't rely on the value read during
        register save as the BIOS have blanked the secondary head.
    Checking if server isn't switched away before calling sync. Sanity check
        for possible bugs in aother areas of the code.
    Fixing default amount of of allocated video memory from AGP for i810: Use
        16MB if less than 192MB are installed else use 24MB (Matthias Hopf).

Author: Egbert Eich <eich@suse.de>
Date:   Wed Sep 15 09:23:59 2004 +0000

    Adding support for OS dependent probing of IA64 chipsets. Not all IA64
        chipsets can be probed without OS support as probing them is only
        possible using ACPI. One example of this are the HP ZX1/2 chipsets:
        previously the code assumed that these chips were present when no other
        of the known chipsets could be probed. This assumption brought SGI
        Altrix machines with 64 CPUs to a grinding halt.

    Unregistering events in XSelectInput() when unregistering IM filter
        callbacks may be a bad idea as others may be interested in this event.
        Removed the call to XSelectInput() altogether as we are in root window
        anyway (Lubos Lunak).
    Fix size of a variable that gets assigned the value of SmartScheduleTime
        (long) to long. This should help to prevent smart scheduler lockup on
        64 bit systems due to overruns (Andreas Schwab).

    Improve error handling, especially in the DRI case. Do some FatalErrors
        instead of ErrorFs for things that are really bad, and put limits on
        some loops. Now, sometimes instead of hanging the entire system, we
        (mostly-) cleanly drop to console when the card has hung.

    - Add disabled WIP trapezoid code for R128 and R100. The R128 rendering is
        not doing an add of 1 per triangle like I hoped, and instead seems to
        be saturating all the pixels or something. The R100 acceleration
        renders pretty well, with some gaps. Note that both are slower than
        software due to lack of DMA to submit vertices.
    - Mostly fix R128 and Radeon transform support, including supporting
        bilinear filtering on R128. Subpixel offsets are still probably an
        issue (reported by rendercheck), but I want to make 100% sure about my
        understanding of the protocol before changing everybody, including fb.
    - Add support for dst formats without alpha to R128 Composite.
    - Remove the R128 Blend code, which has long outlived its usefulness. (I
        kept it around for one reason: It could be useful for the w/h > 1024
        case with no mask and a non-src op. That seems pretty infrequent and
        not worth the trouble).

    - Don't require Imrecise mode for Trapezoid acceleration. It looks like we
        might be able to do Precise in hardware, so leave it up to the driver.
    - Add a helper function for computing a set of offsets for smooth trapezoid
        rasterizing using many sharp trapezoids.

    Add a set of three hooks for accelerating trapezoids, and use it for the
        RasterizeTrapezoid screen function. These hooks will be called for
        imprecise, non-sharp trapezoids with A8 destinations.
    Note that the current main consumer of trapezoids, cairo, is requesting
        precise, sharp trapezoids by not changing the default Picture
        attributes, but gets non-sharp effects in software because fb bases its
        choice of sharp/non-sharp on the mask format being A8 vs A1, and cairo
        asks for A8. Follow fb's (poor?) example by ignoring the sharp setting
        and basing the choice off of the mask being A8.

    Rather than initially place pixmaps in framebuffer based on a size
        heuristic, delay the decision until the first
        kaaPixmapUse{Screen|Memory}, and put it in framebuffer if UseScreen was
        called. Provides a significant improvement in cairo speeds (100%
        speedup in cairogears here) and is likely to improve text performance
        as well.

    Bug #1101: Fix PaintWindow in the pixmap case when the window's origin is
        not at the backing pixmap's origin. Resulted in incorrect rendering in
        at least aisleriot, fluxbox, and KDE apps, and probably many more.
        While here, move the ParentRelative loop above the drawable grab -- may
        improve correctness with ParentRelative background origins as well.
        Note that the border code doesn't handle ParentRelative yet.

    Empty damage object when freeing pixmap.
    Wrap InstallColormap so that the DDX doesn't see colormaps from our ARGB
        visual (avoids lovely green tint to screen). Also, set visual->nplanes
        of ARGB visual to all used (including alpha) planes so DIX can set
        pixel values correctly.
    Translate automatic update regions correctly to account for borders
    When nplanes == 32 (ARGB visuals), mask in all ones for alpha values to
        allocated pixel values.
    Remove redundant fbAddTraps declaration
    Fix fbCopyWindow to work on non-screen pixmaps (not needed yet)

    Apply a kludge to initialize the composite wrapper before DamageSetup. If
        not, DamageSetup will wrap some operations first, and the cw
        initializes during ExtensionInit, so cw comes higher in the wrapping
        chain. cw going first will result in damage getting confused when the
        drawables get changed around.

    - Fix wrapping of GC ops/funcs according to policy described in bug #1045.
    - Remove ValidateGC/ValidatePictures on the redirected drawables/pictures
        -- it's not needed, and DDXs shouldn't be seeing redirected drawables
        in render or GC ops/funcs when cw is running.
    - Mark all GC/Picture state as dirty when moving from redirected to
        non-redirected, since it hadn't been passed down in Change* or
        Validate* while redirected.
    - Remove CreatePicture wrapper that didn't do anything.
    - Comment on why AddTraps wrapper isn't needed.

    - Add a new Render function, CopyPicture, which will update a picture with
        the flagged bits from a source picture. Approved in principle by
        keithp.
    - Use CopyPicture and SetTransform to update most of the backing picture's
        state in the composite wrapper. Filters are still missing.
    - Don't allocate a picture private, now that we calculate clipping properly
        and don't need the serialNumber or stateChanges.
    - Use the format of the source pixmap rather than generating the format
        from the window's visual.
    - Wrap the rest of the Render primitives that were stubbed out before.

    - Use the preferred dixChangeGC instead of DoChangeGC.
    - Simplify a silly loop and clean up a couple of comments.

    - Add two new XAA hooks, SetupForCPUToScreenTexture2 and
        SetupForCPUToScreenAlphaTexture2. These add a dstFormat argument after
        the previous format argument, which the driver needs to use to properly
        set up the destination format. Two new arrays are added for the list of
        destination formats supported that correspond to the previous format
        arrays for sources.
    - Make Render acceleration only occur when the new hook for that
        acceleration type is supplied and the dst format list is set, along
        with the src format list being set. Without knowing the destination
        format, the Render acceleration couldn't properly support all the
        destinations it might encounter.
    - Bump XAA module minor version.
    - Update the Radeon Render acceleration to use the new hooks when the XAA
        module is sufficiently new. Fix a bug in the src/dst alpha booleans for
        ops, and use them to set blend_cntl to support destinations without
        alpha. Add missing PICT_a1r5g5b5 texture format, and add list
        terminator. (!)

    Major improvements to Composite wrapper. Several issues remain, but it now
        appears stable in limited testing.
    - Allocate the picture private, avoiding segfault.
    - Wrap PaintWindow to draw the background/border to the backing pixmap
        (based on Deron Johnson's comptran.c).
    - Set the x_off/y_off returns to translate coordinates properly.
    - Don't bother allocating temporary areas for the modified coordinates.
        Layers above are responsible for handling lower layers changing the
        arguments, so cw doesn't have to worry about it. mibstore.c has to do
        the allocation because it calls down twice (front buffer and backing
        store). (Suggested by keithp)
    - Handle the mode argument to PolyPoint, Polylines, and FillPolygon.
    - Remove some dead elements in the cw privates.
    - Kill a prototype warning in compinit.c by adding the cw.h header.

    The Damage extension has to wrap after (be called before) the Composite
        extension so that the redirecting of drawables by the wrapper doesn't
        confuse Damage.

    Integrate COMPOSITEWRAP branch including composite wrapper. This code still
        has several issues, including:
    - CopyWindow and PaintWindow wrappers missing (will be done soon)
    - Some segfaults seen in the Render wrappers.
    - Xprt server build breaks with Composite.
    - DDXs must be recompiled for Composite due to VisualRec size change.
    - Composite bugs pointed out by Deron Johnson in email.
    Also, reorder XFixes initialization according to comments by Keith which
        are also in xserver CVS.

    Add new extension enable/disable feature. This code is a small step in the
        right direction -- i.e., moving towards full run-time config of

        supported.

        framebuffer formats except cfb and the overlay modes should work, and
        r128 and radeon need to be loaded from the ati driver (both issues to

    Addition of console input after removal of core backend input that is not

        pixmaps for XGetImage must be obtained from another screen.

    Commit the rest of the dirty optimization from 20040703 and add a missing
        header include. I don't know how this happened, but I'm going to blame
        a "few" fscks having happened between testing the code and committing
        (due to other driver changes that made me not blame dirty for the
        failures I saw) for disappearance of kasync.c changes. Fixes a lot of
        corruption.

Author: Egbert Eich <eich@suse.de>

    ifdef'ed some IA32-only assembler statements. Presently these chipsets are
        IA32 only, anyway (Egbert Eich).
    Disabling generic VGA testing for IA64 architectures. Temporarily disabling
        support for ZX1 bus. This code is extremely invasive and is executed as
        fallback without testing for a ZX1 chipset. It brings a SGI Altrix to a
        grinding halt. (Egbert Eich).

    Separated Intel drivers from default DriDrivers to avoid building them on
        IA64 (Egbert Eich).
    Fixed wrong function prototype (Egbert Eich).
    Don't test for generic VGA on IA64 (Egbert Eich).
    Fixed a segfault when accessing a structure before verifying the pointer
        exists (Egbert Eich).
    Added a showcache option for debugging (Egbert Eich).
    Increase default video RAM size to 16MB when DRI is enabled and more than
        128MB are available (Egbert Eich). Fixed lockups during mode switch.
        Problem was introduced when attempting to copy the behavior during
        LeaveVT()/EnterVT() but but forgetting to call I810DRILeave() before
        I810DRIEnter(). The entire DRILeave()/Enter() scenario has been
        commented out as it didn't seem to be necessary (Egbert Eich).
    Fix TweakMemorySize() (tested with i855/i865) (Egbert Eich).
    increased MAX_DEVICES to 128 (Egbert Eich).
    Use OS provided PCI config space access as default method (Egbert Eich).
    Added support for Linux 2.6 proc file format.
    Fixed unaligned accesses to pieces of the VBE info block. VESA did not
        align elements to size (Egbert Eich).

        offscreen pixmap area, and set it when any rendering occurs. When

Author: Eric Anholt <anholt@freebsd.org>
Date:   Tue Jun 29 20:37:51 2004 +0000

    Add an offscreen area scoring to improve choosing offscreen areas to kick
        out when allocation can't find a free area of the requested size. When
        offscreen pixmaps get used, the offscreen area's score is increased by
        a constant value. Every certain number of increases, all offscreen area
        scores get decreased by a fraction. When choosing a set of areas to
        remove for a new allocation, the set of areas with the smallest total
        score is chosen for removal. While this is not the smartest system, it
        prevents things like always removing the first offscreen area in memory
        (likely the most recent) to be kicked out when doing replacing.

    - Pass the right pixel mask (all ones) in to PrepareSolid in the
        solid-fill-based composite acceleration.
    - Use a real pixmap when doing an UploadToScratch (For pDrawable->type ==
        DRAWABLE_WINDOW, you need to get the backing pixmap).
    - Pass back the x/y offsets from kaaGetOffscreenPixmap unconditionally,
        because they'll be used in the scratch case.
    - Turn on the Render acceleration for Rage 128 and Radeon 100-series at
        last!

    Allow for multiple composite-based visuals, then add an RGB24 visual in
        addition to the ARGB32 one. This allows 'glitz' to run on top of any X
        server using mesa.
    Switch to using 32bpp for depth 24 pixmaps (even when the frame buffer is
        not depth 24).

    Fix SYNC_ALWAYS (debugging) code to use mach64WaitIdle instead of
        KdCheckSync -- the boolean used in the latter won't be set yet.
    Oops. == instead of =.
    Must sync hardware before rasterizing trapezoids in case the mask is in
        off-screen memory and has just been erased. Yes, it is silly to place
        masks in off-screen memory. That's a separate issue.

    Pin header-only pixmaps in memory.
    Off-screen reallocation could have used a stale pointer.
    Separate framebuffer mapping computation from actual frame buffer mapping.
        Now map the frame buffer from vesaEnable so that VT switch shares the
        same mapping code. This makes sure any shadow framebuffer is allocated
        again.

    Overhaul of the ATI driver:
    - Add monochrome hardware cursor support.
    - Try to auto-detect AGP support for DRI on Radeons. And fail. Detect it
        properly on R128.
    - Set up card for pseudo-DMA if possible. Convert 2D rendering code to
        prepare DMA packets only. Use generic code to decode DMA packets to
        MMIO if PDMA is unavailable. Add WIP code to support "real" DMA without
        DRM support.
    - Dispatch pending DMA commands when the server sleeps. Otherwise some
        things, such as typing in an xterm, wouldn't show up for a time.
    - Fix Radeon Composite acceleration in many ways, and add Rage 128
        Composite acceleration. Disable them both due to still-not-understood
        issues they have. They fail with In, Out, AtopReverse, and Xor, and
        text rendering is strange.
    - Add textured XV support for R100 and Rage 128. No brightness/sat
        controls, but it does support multiple ports, and cooperates with
        Composite.
    - Add WIP code for hostdata uploads.
    - Many cleanups and fixes.

    Fix problems in render fb implementation found by rendercheck:
    - fbCombineSaturate was pointed at fbCombineDisjointOver, instead of
        fbCombineDisjointOverReverse as it should. Instead, point
        fbCombineDisjointOverReverse at fbCombineSaturate (which is likely to
        be faster).
    - fix previously-unused fbCombineSaturate implementation.
    - fbCombineMaskAlphaC was just a copy of fbCombineMaskValueC. Make it do
        what it's supposed to (return a cs.alpha).
    - fbCombineAtopC didn't invert the source alpha value.
    - fix copy'n'paste errors in fbCombine(Dis/Con)jointGeneralC, also source
        alpha wasn't treated in a component fashion.
    - fbCompositeSrc_8888* didn't handle when the source lacks an alpha
        channel. Rather than adding that and possilby slowing down the (normal)
        alpha case, don't let x8r8g8b8/x8b8g8r8 Pictures be used in
        fbCompositeSrc_8888* because Over with one of these is just Src.

    small fixes, but still can't get this driver woking again

commit b526276faa765df893197e04370a915ed73947dc
Author: Brent Cook <busterbcook@yahoo.com>
Date:   Mon Apr 5 02:52:35 2004 +0000

    removed hardcoded vesa references so we can operate with any backend. fbdev
        works for initializing the screen, but input fails shortly after.

commit 920e6ff81baeec16465f81bacbcff711ce82e149
Author: Brent Cook <busterbcook@yahoo.com>
Date:   Sun Apr 4 07:30:07 2004 +0000

    Begin separating VESA calls into a more generic backend wrapper like the
        ati driver, cascading between VESA and FBDEV. We only have init
        functions done so far; need to add all of the others. Fixed some
        compiler warnings. Whitespace and formatting cleanups (using 4 spaces,
        no tabs)

    added touchscreen support, detect all known PCI chips in the Neomagic line.
        We'll not bother with ISA for now.

    initial import of original driver by Franco Catrin L. Wraps VESA for most
        parts, with some hardware acceleration enabled for the cursor on the
        NM2300.

Date:   Tue Mar 30 14:23:15 2004 +0000

    36. Conversion: __AMD64__ > __amd64__ (Egbert Eich).
    35. Fixed stretching option and centering in C&T driver (Egbert Eich).
    34. Added support for memory size tweaking in BIOS for i845 (Egbert Eich,
        thanks to Christian Ziez)
    33. Removed video playback dependency on Accel in NSC drivers (Egbert
    3Eich).
    32. Fix HW cursor state on Savage driver when entering VT as some BIOSes
        seem to enable it unconditionally (Egbert Eich).
    31. Fixed Emulate3Button message to distinguish between 'hard' (ie.
        configured) and 'soft' (ie. automatic emulation that is disabled as
        soon as the middle button is pressed) (Egbert Eich).
    30. Free XrmDB in XCloseDisplay() only when implicitely allocated by
        XGetDefaults(). If Client allocates it itself it should free it also.
        Trying to free it for the client may result in segfault if the client
        has already freed it (Egbert Eich).

    Twenty link errors for Xizzle now - count 'em. 20.
    Get rid of all references to SCO.
    Change SDK include dir to $(includedir)/xizzle. Add SDK libs where
        necessary.
    Reformat to be nicer and easier to shuffle around; also, fix lib ordering
        so we get so much closer to the elusive final link. Shuffle
        common/xf86Init.c into libxizzle.a.
    Fix a couple of early snafus - s/BUILDXI/XINPUT/, et al; make the SDK stuff
        conditional as needed; fix the SBus includes.
    Name library os-support/libxizzleos.a, not os-support/foo/libxizzlefoo.a.
        Clean up ARCH_SOURCES so it's always initialised to something.
    Move linked libraries to _LIBADD, which somehow escaped my attention. Make
        inclusion of drm/libxizzlelinuxdrm.a dependent on DRI.
    s/VERSION/VBE_VERSION/;
    Axe this redundant dir.
    All Xizzle-specific: axe hw/xizzle/Xi, shuffle link order, fix list of
        required modules to be vaguely sane, add some pertinent libs/incs.

        API/ABI so that third-party drivers that depend on symbols like
        noPanoramiXExtension, etc., would not need to be recompiled. Toobad gcc
        on Linux doesn't support ELF's weak symbols as that would have been a
        reasonable solution for preserving the ABI. N.B.: While symbols, i.e.
        functions and variables revert to the old name, I did not revert build
        names, i.e. -DXINERAMA, to the old -DPANORAMIX. There was no need, and
        it's just a build issue that has no impact on the binary output of the
        build.

        generating Alt_L, etc, fix the implementation so that you get Meta_L
        for the left Meta key and Meta_R for the right Meta key. Ditto for Alt,
        Control, and Shift.

    More NULL checks. These ones are more useful than the last (which just made

        the basic simplest case driver now (not that i'm lazy, mind :-p)

    - Reserve areas for back/depth/span when USING_DRI && GLXEXT. This would be
        better in a TransitionTo3d, but we'd need to work with the offscreen
        memory manager for that.
    - Misc. fixes to ati_dri.c for DRI+GLX. Needs more work still.

    Forced commit: Previous commit included the removal of the 8192 scanline
        limit on offscreen memory in the fbdev case. I remember daenzer (who
        originally put that code in) saying he wasn't sure of it, and there
        doesn't seem to be any reason for that limit given how acceleration is
        done.

    - Add a new UploadToScratch kaa hook for putting the data for a single
        pixmap into temporary offscreen storage. Subsequent UploadToScratch may
        clobber the data of previous ones. This allows hardware acceleration of
        composite operations on glyphs.
    - Add a new UploadToScreen kaa hook for doing the actual moving of data to
        framebuffer. This would allow us to do things like hostdata blits or
        memcpy to agp and then blit.
    - Add an UploadToScreen on ATI which is just memcpy, but which will be
        replaced with a hostdata blit soon.
    - Add UploadToScratch on ATI and reserve 64k of scratch space. This
        provided a 3x speedup of rgb24text on my Radeon.

    Speed things up slightly by removing Z values from emitted vertices and by
        emitting as a tri fan rather than a tri list. A rect list would save an
        additional vertex (out of 4) per rectangle, but there's no measurable
        speed difference and the tri fan may be useful when transforms come
        into play.

    - Add more Composite operations, including Saturate, to Radeon Composite
        accel. I don't 100% trust that the math works for Saturate, but I can't
        tell from existing information.
    - Fix texture pitch fallback checks.
    - Fallback when src or mask have transforms.
    - Disable Radeon Composite accel until the offset thing is fixed.
    - Set offscreenPitch to 64 on Radeon thanks to new information and a kaa
        fix. Fixes acceleration at width!=1024.

    Split the various attempts at accelerating Composite into separate

        where the coordinates would get messed up if acceleration failed due to
        things like pixmaps being in the wrong locations.

    - Add new Composite hook for kdrive drivers, which only ensures that the
        pixmaps are offscreen and don't have alpha maps. It is the last case
        checked before going to software fallback
    - Use the new Composite hook in the ati driver to implement acceleration of
        most Composites that get done in an xcompmgr environment on r100 series
        cards. It is only available when using the DRM. There are still some
        corruption issues, but the DRI is still non-default and I need to get
        this into version control.

    Merge dri-0-1-branch to trunk. Notable changes:
    - Add libdrm and libdri. Portions of the DRI extension are stubbed out.
    - Use the DRM in the ATI driver when available. This provides a minor
        performance improvement in x11perf, and opens the possibility of using
        the 3d hardware for acceleration in the future.
    - Implement solid fill acceleration for Composite in KAA.
    - Implement Blend hook for Composite and use it on r128.
    - Fix a bug of mine that resulted in overuse of offscreen memory.
    - Fix many miscellaneous bugs in ATI driver and add PCI IDs.

    First pass at "Standard" Xinerama. The sources for this came from Heather
        Lanigan's xinerama tree on Sourceforge.Net. No attempt has been made to
        handle previous, non-standard versions of the protocol. Nor has any
        attempt been made to preserve the ABI of previous versions -- that part
        will be added at a later time, and then probably only on systems that
        have nice object/linker semantics, e.g. ELF systems with weak symbols.

        the ATI driver. It suffers from hw/sw synchronization problems, it
        looks like, but may be good enough to work on Render acceleration
        experiments. Committing it as-is so I don't lose it again.

    - Add a workaround for apparent broken acceleration with Rage 128 and
        offset alignment with 8-bit acceleration (24-hack and plain 8-bit).
    - Minor cleanup of setup code.

    - Fix confusion of depth/bitsPerPixel in ati_draw.c
    - Disable acceleration with 24bpp due to apparent broken acceleration.
        Accel at 24bpp was the cause of the crashes when people tried to use
        any depth over 16. XFree86 doesn't support 24 either.
    - Disable at < 8bpp, too.
    - Add the other Rage 128 PCI IDs.
    - Remove unnecessary setting of scissor registers (only default scissor
        gets used).

    - Add PCI information (device/vendor id, bus location) to KdCardAttr to
        help with ati, and future DRM drivers.
    - Add new "ati" kdrive driver. It has ancestry in the r128 driver from
        andersca, but took a detour through being the WIP SiS 300 driver on the
        way. It supports Radeons (tested on QD VIVO and 7500) and Rage 128.
        Current limitations include that it requires depth 16 and that the
        other Rage 128 PCI IDs aren't included yet.

    Have the composite extension tell the damage extension about clients which
        have redirected subwindows in manual mode. Those clients are marked
        Critical and given a significant scheduling boost whenever they receive
        a damage notify event. This dramatically improves update frequency.

    Ok, Composite extension is semi-working; when no-one asks for redirection,
        the server seems to act as before. With RedirectSubwindows (root,
        automatic), the server looks just like a regular X server. Now to go
        rewrite the (currently lame) compositing manager to get some real
        action on the screen.
    Some of the fixes here are to make valgrind quiet with various ioctls used
        by kdrive/linux.

    Avoid attempting acceleration on non-screen formats (for now)
    Offscreen allocator API changes.

commit cb46169759a833605b78409ae68c9fb57618ceba
Author: Keith Packard <keithp@keithp.com>
Date:   Tue Oct 14 21:10:53 2003 +0000

    Use same assumptions as layergc about what layer kind is approprate for
        unwrapping pixmap operations. This makes sure the accelerated code gets
        invoked for pixmaps
    Add pixmap migration support to kaa. Can't quite automatically migrate
        pixmaps off-screen, but soon we will. Can kick objects out of video
        memory. Move per-screen linked list pointers to pixmap private. Wrap
        Composite in preparation for migrating pixmaps. Have kasync ignore
        drawable type so that pixmaps trigger sync Add KdOffscreenFini to
        cleanup on server reset. Switch off screen area to have only a 'save'
        function; moving objects to off screen memory is done by saving then
        freeing the area.

        GATOS project, Egbert Eich, Marc La France).
    133. Reorganise ATI Mach64 support into separate source files (Marc La
        France).
    132. Refine atimisc's decoding of the panel mode on server entry in an
        attempt to reduce the effect of atyfb bugs (Marc La France).
    131. Make Rage128 and Radeon XVideo available even when 2D acceleration is
        disabled (Marc La France).
    130. There is no longer any need to require hardware cursors during Rage128
        and Radeon XVideo displays (Marc La France).
    129. Initialise v4l's XVideo adaptors last (Marc La France).
    128. Reduce cut&paste effects by adding more helpers to Xv (derived from
        #5645, Bjrn Augustsson, Marc La France).
    127. Centralise a region comparison primitive into 'mi' and use it instead
        of local definitions throughout the server (Marc La France).
    126. DPMSExtension & XvExtension driver cleanups (Marc La France).

Author: Egbert Eich <eich@suse.de>
Date:   Mon Sep 16 18:05:35 2002 +0000

    319. Moved LdPreLib define after the vendor/OS specific config files as it
        may depend on setting done there (Egbert Eich).
    318. Several fixes for cross compile environment (Egbert Eich).
    317. Added code to allow for building of static only libraries with
    -fPIC for platforms which require it (Egbert Eich).
    316. Added '-m32' to gcc flags as default for ia32 builds when gcc version
        is >= 3.1. This allows building a 32 bit Version of X on 64bit x86-64
        (Egbert Eich).
    315. Changed direct calls of ld to 'gcc -nostdlib' for Linux (Egbert Eich).
    314. Changed calls to as to 'gcc -c -x assembler-with-cpp' for Linux
        (Egbert Eich).
    313. Added '-fno-strict-aliasing' flag to gcc version >= 3.1 (Egbert Eich).
        Strict requires that one address must not contain pointers to different
        types - a feature heavily used by X (Egbert Eich).
    312. Fixed a core dump problem in libXtt (?) (Egbert Eich).
    311. Removed '#pragma pack' from structures that contain function pointers
        in x86emu. This causes problems on gcc 3.1 for ia64 (Egbert Eich).
    310. Added defines for missing X types to saverproto.h (Egbert Eich).
    309. Fixed compiler warings generated by gcc >= 3.1 in mesa drivers (Egbert
        Eich).
    308. For platforms that allow both 32 and 64 bit libraries to be executed
        split Xlib i18n modules path into
        <libpath>/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/lib/common and
        <libpath>/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/lib64/common. 'lib64' has been defined
        to be the default path for 64bit shared libraries on these platforms
        (Egbert Eich).
    307. Fixed obvious typo in OMlib (Egbert Eich).
    306. Fixed code in cfb that didn't comply with C sequence rules. Modern C
        compilers tend to be more aggressive on code reordering (Egbert Eich).
    305. Changed arguments of NoopDDA() from VarArgs to void. Handling of
        VarArgs by gcc isn't compatible with the way it was used on certain
        platforms (Egbert Eich).
    304. Added support for 32bit pixmaps for 24bit overlay framebuffers in fb
        overlay code (Egbert Eich).
    303. Fixed kdrive to print a meaningful error message instead of just core
        dump when no matching graphics cards is found (Egbert Eich).
    302. fixed portability bug in xwd (Andreas Schwab <schwab@suse.de>)
    301. fixed X Server crash, which happended each time a proportional
        iso10646 font was loaded with xtt backend (Yong Li
        <rigel863@yahoo.com>)
    300. Added some ARM specific fixes to compiler.h (Uli Hecht).
    299. Added a virtual 'dummy' driver (Egbert Eich).
    298. Fixed core dump when certain access functions are not set in xf86Bus.c
        (Egbert Eich).
    297. Fixed problem where SIGIO could be disabled after a server reset.
    296. Added configurable list of devices the xf86Misc extension is allowed
        to change the mouse device to (Egbert Eich).
    295. Changed default mouse type to 'auto' when generating config file with
        '-configure' (Egbert Eich).
    294. Made sure keyboard modifier settings are consistent after exit from
        DGA when the xkb extension is used (Egbert Eich).
    293. Disabled keyboard processing when Xserver is suspended by power
        management. This allows effective locking of laptops when stolen
        (Egbert Eich).
    292. Added/improved options for lockfile syncing (Egbert Eich).
    291. Added support for backup copy of Xserver logfile (Egbert Eich).
    290. Fixed GetTimeInMillis() to use deltas instead of absolute time
        returend by gettimeofday(). This ensures time is monotonic in X (Egbert
        Eich).
    289. Fixed xf86Misc extension to allow modification of Expps2 mice (Egbert
        Eich).
    288. Made code in xf86MiscExt.c more readable (Egbert Eich).
    287. Fixed PCI CardBus bridge handling (Egbert Eich).
    286. Added code to reenable PCI bus mastering after coming back from a VT
        switch to radeon driver (Charl P. Botha <http://cpbotha.net/>) (Egbert
        Eich).
    285. Dito for r128 driver (M. Harris).
    284. Dito for glint and mga driver (Egbert Eich).
    283. Fixed double scan issues for low res modes in C&T driver (Egbert
        Eich).
    282. Set rgbBits to 8 for all HiQV chips in chips driver (Egbert Eich).
    281. Moved initialization of accel funtions past initialization of
        offscreen fb manager in chips driver (Egbert Eich).
    280. Fixed initialization of video in chips driver (?).
    279. Fixed HALlib problem restoring text mode on G550 (Egbert Eich).
    278. Restructured and included Matrox's Merged Framebuffer changes to mga
        driver (Egbert Eich).
    277. G450/550 clockchip programming fixes (Matrox).
    276. Fixed HW Cursor for HALlib frame granularity (Egbert Eich).
    275. Enabling 2D accel in 24-bit for neomagic 2360 and 2380 (Egbert Eich).
    274. Added support for builtin 1024x480 mode of Sony subnotebooks for
        Neomagic driver (Egbert Eich).
    273. Fixed support for lowRes (320x240) modes in neomagic driver (Egbert
        Eich).
    272. Fixed RAC function registration in S3 driver (Egbert Eich).
    271. Added some voodoo to screen initialization of S3 driver (Egbert Eich).
    270. Fixed vbe/int10 support in SMI driver. It used to core dump when BIOS
        was not usable (Egbert Eich).
    269. Separated BRIGHTNESS and and CAPTURE_BRIGNTESS video attributes in smi
        driver: CAPTURE_BRIGHTNESS refers to the capture chip (ie. Philips
        SAA7110) while BRIGHTNESS controls the video overlay of the SMI chip
        itself (Egbert Eich).
    268. Disable automatic loading of DRI when running SUN ffb as this is
        inconsistent with other drivers (Thorsten Kukuk).
    267. Fixed Gamma/Brightness code in trident driver (Egbert Eich).
    266. Added FpDelay debugging option (Egbert Eich).
    260. Fixed video support for Trident 9397 (Egbert Eich).
    265. Fixed Cursor/VT switch support for vmware driver (Egbert Eich).
    264. Fixed Blit problems in vmware driver when running KDE (Egbert Eich).
    263. Added RENDER support to vmware driver (Egbert Eich).
    262. Added C&T 69030 to extrapci.ids (Egbert Eich).
    261. Improved mouse autodetection code (Egbert Eich).
    260. Restructured int10 code so that vm86 and x86emu support can be loaded
        as modules. Implemented heuristic to try vm86 first and fall back to
        x86emu. This allows 32 bit Xservers to run on x86_64 on 64-bit kernel
        without vm86 support (Egbert Eich).
    259. Restructured elf loader: determine which section to load from
        elfheader flags (Egbert Eich).
    258. Adding RENDER Support to RAC (Egbert Eich).
    257. Using borderClip instead of borderSize region for redisplay function
        in miext/shadow code to avoid core dumps when vt switched away (Egbert
        Eich).
    256. Replacing sprintf() by snprintf() in lbxproxy to eliminate possible
        buffer overrun exploits (Egbert Eich).
    255. KP_Decimal fixes to Czech and Slovak keybards (Jan Holesovsky
        <kendy@suse.cz>) (Egbert Eich).
