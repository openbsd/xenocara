    Only use the current information when setting modes
    
    Before we change the state (e.g. adding a mode or applying one to an
    output), we query the screen resources for the right identifiers. This
    should only use the current information rather than force a reprobe on
    all hardware - not only can that reprobe be very slow (e.g. EDID
    timeouts on the order of seconds), but it may perturb the setup that the
    user is trying to configure.

    Mark all CRTC as currently unused for second picking CRTC pass
    
    We perform two passes over the CRTC in order to find the preferred CRTC
    for each enabled output. In the first pass, we try to preserve the
    existing output <-> CRTC relationships (to avoid unnecessary flicker).
    If that pass fails, we try again but with all outputs first disabled.
    However, the logic to preserve an active CRTC was not disabled along
    with the outputs - meaning that if one was active but its associated
    output was disabled by the user, then that CRTC would remain unavailable
    for other outputs. The result would be that we would try to assign more
    CRTC than available (i.e. if the user request 3 new HDMI outputs on a
    system with only 3 CRTC, and wished to switch off an active internal
    panel, we would report "cannot find CRTC" even though that configuration
    could be established.)

    When an output is disabled via the cmdline, we can use that information

    xrandr: use full range for gamma table generation
    
    Calculate gamma table using full [0,65536) range and do not make any

    Gamma table size has nothing to do with number of significant bits in hardware.
    In particular we are dealing now with gamma table that has 17 entries and 8
    bit precision, there are other GPUs with 10 bit precision and less than 256
    entries using partial linear approximation. Deriving assumed gamma table
    significant bits from size of gamma table leads to incorrect calculations and

    Bug 56923 - Make command line options consistent (single vs double dash)
    
    Most of xrandr's command line options follow the system of single
    dashes for single character options (e.g. "-v") and double dashes for
    long options ("--version").  The only exceptions are "-display" and
    "-help", most likely for historical reasons.  To make the behavior
    consistent across all options, the following patch adds "--display"
    and "--help" as alternatives to the current inconsistency.  The man
    page got updated as well, recommending double-dash variants for both
    options. The old behavior is still supported, so the patch should not

    Commit b26fd532b3dab222956ea27eef4e41345978b5b2 redid how xrandr prints

    disambiguate.  For example,
    
        Broadcast RGB: Automatic
            supported: Automatic, Full, Limited 16:235

    Bug #11397: check that numeric --orientation arguments are in range
    
    The only valid parameters to -o (--orientation) are 0, 1, 2, 3, normal, left,
    inverted, and right.  xrandr converts the strings to numbers and then checks
    that they're within range, but doesn't validate them if it was numeric to begin
    with.
    
    Move the range check outside of the if statement so that out-of-range numeric
    values are rejected properly.

    xrandr: Fix variable declaration warnings
    
    There are piles of places in the code where a variable shadows either another
    variable or a global function:
    
      xrandr.c:545:35: warning: declaration of ‘index’ shadows a global declaration [-Wshadow]
      xrandr.c:574:9: warning: declaration of ‘index’ shadows a global declaration [-Wshadow]
      xrandr.c:967:19: warning: declaration of ‘gamma’ shadows a global declaration [-Wshadow]
      xrandr.c:1329:16: warning: declaration of ‘gamma’ shadows a global declaration [-Wshadow]
      xrandr.c:2055:28: warning: declaration of ‘outputs’ shadows a global declaration [-Wshadow]
      xrandr.c:2068:29: warning: declaration of ‘outputs’ shadows a global declaration [-Wshadow]
      xrandr.c:2928:16: warning: declaration of ‘output’ shadows a previous local [-Wshadow]
      xrandr.c:2995:15: warning: declaration of ‘output’ shadows a previous local [-Wshadow]
      xrandr.c:3016:15: warning: declaration of ‘j’ shadows a previous local [-Wshadow]
      xrandr.c:3018:19: warning: declaration of ‘rotations’ shadows a previous local [-Wshadow]
      xrandr.c:3116:15: warning: declaration of ‘crtc’ shadows a previous local [-Wshadow]

      xrandr.c:3243:20: warning: declaration of ‘mode’ shadows a previous local [-Wshadow]
    
    'index' and 'gamma' are C library functions:
    
      index (3)            - locate character in string
      gamma (3)            - (logarithm of the) gamma function
    
    The rest of these are either variables or function parameters.
    
    When possible, move the declaration of a variable into the block where it is
    used, including in cases where the same variable is used in multiple blocks but
    the later block doesn't depend on the value from the earlier block.
    
    In a few cases, rename the variable in the outer scope to be more specific (e.g.
    output -> config_output) so the more generic variable in the inner scope (e.g.
    the 'output' variable used to iterate over all outputs) doesn't have to change.

    XRRSetCrtcTransform takes a non-const char* filter parameter even though it
    doesn't actually modify the string.  Instead of trying to work around that, just
    live with the warning for now:

    xrandr: fix gamma == 1.0 && sigbits != 8
    
    The gamma-correction lookup table managed through XRR[GS]etCrtcGamma is
    2^n in size, where 'n' is the number of significant bits in the X Color.
    Each element in the gamma-correction lookup table is a 16:16:16 X Color
    (i.e., in the range [0,65536) ).  The significant bits of each component
    of each element in the lookup table are programmed into the hardware
    lookup table.  Meaningful values in the gamma-correction lookup table
    are thus in the range [0,2^sigbits), where all values are shifted into
    the MSBs (i.e., left shifted by (16 - sigificant bits)).

    Add a --scale-from option
    
    A typical case for wanting to specify a scale on an output is making your
    framebuffer be one size and scaling it to fill an output of a different size.
    Instead of making the user calculate the scaling factors to be specified by
    --scale, add a new option, --scale-from, that lets the user specify the
    framebuffer size directly.  Compute the appropriate transform to achieve the

    find_mode was still picking the first string match rather than the

    xrandr: get gamma and brightness
    
    Even in verbose query mode, gamma and brigthness were not displayed.
    That's because they are not stored in the server the same way they are
    specified on the command line: they are stored as 256 * 3 u16 while
    the command line is 3 + 1 floats.  Still, this is useful info for the
    users, and they don't care about how it's stored in the server.
    
    So we do a regression over the values stored to recover info in the same
    way as on the command line: gamma and brightness.

    Gamma is an array of 3 16-bit values. Currently, the maximum value assigned is
    255*256, which is only 65280. Make sure that when we set the gamma, the maximum
    value is 65535. It's slightly brighter but also helps to avoid kludges to
    detect clamped values when reading back the gamma.

    Sometimes they are not in sync so it's safer to rely on checks made

    RANDR_MAJOR is 1 and RANDR_MINOR 2 but xrandr.c try to use it anyway.

    As an interim measure, replace AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([dist-bzip2]) with
    AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([foreign dist-bzip2]). This will prevent the generation
    of the INSTALL file. It is also part of the 24206 solution.

    Fix for 64bit: feed a pointer to the right size variable to scanf().
    
    XID is unsigned long, however %x in scanf takes a pointer to an unsigned int.
    Thus with XID xid, a sscanf(..., "0x%x", &xid) will most likely produce the
    wrong results.

    Use IDs for mode selection instead of hand-crafted <w>x<h>@<r> strings.
    
    Some machines provide e.g. multiple 1024x768@60 modes with /slightly/
    different timings. Often only one of them can be used on multiple outputs.

    Add xrandr test suite.
    
    At the moment it only tests setting one output at a time, it should be
    improved to add some multi-output setting as well.  Also it only tests clone
    modes at the moment, no multi-monitor setups.

    Always reset other outputs using the best crtc.
    
    pick_crtcs_score() didn't set up crtcs references correctly if anything but
    the last output resulted in the best score.

    Verify crtc against previous config.
    
    When selecting a crtc for an output, it doesn't check for already attached
    outputs in check_crtc_for_output(), and so may select an crtc that is already
    in use.
    E.g. when changing from a cloned mode the displays won't be split up to
    different crtcs, but the same crtc will be used, changing the resolution for
    the unspecified display as well.

Date:   Thu Mar 15 20:55:30 2007 -0700

    Make --auto after --output only affect the output.
    
    --auto has two meanings; if presented before any --output flags, it requests
    that connected-but-disabled outputs be enable while disconnected-but-enabled
    outputs be disabled. After --output, --auto simply asks that the mode used
    for the output be automatically selected. Mixing these two operations is not
    a good default.

    Correct crtc selection algorithm to choose a crtc which will be used by
    outputs which can all share the same crtc.
    
    Also, make randr 1.0 commands work even when --verbose is specified, and

    Merge branch 'randr-1.2-origin' into randr-1.2. Detect invalid mode.
    
    Invalid mode test was checking wrong mode index. Also, print more
    informative error message when this occurs.

    Name CRTCs by index or id. Use current CRTC to get current mode.
    
    CRTCs have no intrinsic name, so let users provide either the number in the
    list or the XID when referring to them explicitly.
    When no mode is specified, look up the current CRTC for the output and use
    that mode, instead of using the mode on the target CRTC.
    When switching an output from one CRTC

    Add --preferred and --auto support.
    
    --preferred selects the 'best' mode for the monitor automatically, either by
    looking for a preferred mode, or selecting one which is closest to the
    current screen DPI.
    
    --auto checks connected status and disables the output if disconnected,
    otherwise it enables it with the preferred mode (as if --preferred).

    mark disabled crtc as changing, set rotation to 90 for disabled crtc.
    
    --off code was not correctly finding and marking the to-be-disabled crtc,
    and the disabling code was sending an uninitialized rotation value to the
    server when no outputs were connected.
