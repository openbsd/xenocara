.SH NAME
xterm \- terminal emulator for X
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B \*n
[\-\fItoolkitoption\fP ...] [\-\fIoption\fP ...] [\fIshell\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fI\*n\fP program is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.
It provides DEC VT102/VT220 and selected features from higher-level
terminals such as VT320/VT420/VT520 (VTxxx).
It also provides Tektronix 4014 emulation
for programs that cannot use the window system directly.
If the underlying operating system supports
terminal resizing capabilities (for example, the SIGWINCH signal in systems
derived from 4.3BSD), \fI\*n\fP will use the facilities to notify programs
running in the window whenever it is resized.
.
.PP
The VTxxx and Tektronix 4014 terminals each have their own window so that you
can edit text in one and look at graphics in the other at the same time.
To maintain the correct aspect ratio (height/width), Tektronix graphics will
be restricted to the largest box with a 4014's aspect ratio that will fit in
the window.
This box is located in the upper left area of the window.
.
.PP
Although both windows may be displayed at the same time, one of them is
considered the \*(``active\*('' window for receiving keyboard input and terminal
output.
This is the window that contains the text cursor.
The active window can be chosen through escape sequences,
the \*(``VT Options\*('' menu in the VTxxx window, and the \*(``Tek Options\*(''
menu in the 4014 window.
.
.SH EMULATIONS
The VT102 emulation is fairly complete, but does not support
autorepeat.
Double-size characters are displayed properly if your font server supports
scalable fonts.
The VT220 emulation does not support soft fonts, it is otherwise complete.
.PP
Terminal database (\fIterminfo\fP (5) or \fItermcap\fP (5))
entries that work with \fI\*n\fP include
.IP
an optional platform-specific entry (\*(``__default_termname__\*(''),
.br
\*(``xterm\*('',
.br
\*(``vt102\*('',
.br
\*(``vt100\*('',
.br
\*(``ansi\*('' and
.br
\*(``dumb\*(''
.PP
\fI\*N\fP automatically searches the
terminal database in this order for these entries and then
sets the \*(``TERM\*('' and the \*(``TERMCAP\*('' environment variables.
You may also use \*(``vt220\*('',  but must set the terminal emulation level
with the \fBdecTerminalID\fP resource.
On most systems, \fI\*n\fP will use the terminfo database.
Some older systems use termcap.
(The \*(``TERMCAP\*('' environment variable is not set if \fI\*n\fP is linked
against a terminfo library, since the requisite information is not provided
by the termcap emulation of terminfo libraries).
.
.PP
Many of the special
.I \*n
features may be modified under program control
through a set of escape sequences different from the standard VT102 escape
sequences.
(See the
.I "Xterm Control Sequences"
document.)
.
.PP
The Tektronix 4014 emulation is also fairly good.
It supports 12-bit graphics addressing, scaled to the window size.
Four different font sizes and five different lines types are supported.
There is no write-through or defocused mode support.
The Tektronix text and graphics commands are recorded internally by
.I \*n
and may be written to a file by sending the COPY escape sequence (or through
the
.B Tektronix
menu; see below).
The name of the file will be
\*(``\fBCOPY\fIyyyy\fB\-\fIMM\fB\-\fIdd\fB.\fIhh\fB:\fImm\fB:\fIss\fR\*('', where
.IR yyyy ,
.IR MM ,
.IR dd ,
.IR hh ,
.I mm
and
.I ss
are the year, month, day, hour, minute and second when the COPY was performed
(the file is created in the directory
.I \*n
is started in, or the home directory for a login
.IR \*n ).
.
.PP
Not all of the features described in this manual are necessarily available in
this version of \fI\*n\fP.
Some (e.g., the non-VT220 extensions) are available
only if they were compiled in, though the most commonly-used are in the
default configuration.
.
.SH "OTHER FEATURES"
\fI\*N\fP automatically highlights the text cursor when the
pointer enters the window (selected) and unhighlights it when the pointer
leaves the window (unselected).
If the window is the focus window, then the text cursor is
highlighted no matter where the pointer is.
.
.PP
In VT102 mode, there are escape sequences to activate and deactivate
an alternate screen buffer, which is the same size as the display area
of the window.
When activated, the current screen is saved and replaced with the alternate
screen.
Saving of lines scrolled off the top of the window is disabled until the
normal screen is restored.
The usual terminal description for \fI\*n\fP allows the visual editor
.IR vi (1)
to switch to the alternate screen for editing and to restore the screen
on exit.
A popup menu entry makes it simple to switch between the normal and
alternate screens for cut and paste.
.
.PP
In either VT102 or Tektronix mode, there are escape sequences to change the
name of the windows.
Additionally, in VT102 mode,
\fI\*n\fP implements the window-manipulation control
sequences from \fIdtterm\fP, such as resizing the window, setting its location
on the screen.
.
.PP
\fI\*N\fP allows character-based applications to receive mouse events (currently
button-press and release events, and button-motion events)
as keyboard control sequences.
See \fIXterm Control Sequences\fP for details.
.
.\" ***************************************************************************
.SH OPTIONS
The \fI\*n\fP terminal emulator
accepts the standard X Toolkit command line options as well as
many application-specific options.
If the option begins with a
.RB ` + '
instead of a
.RB ` \- ',
the option is restored to its default value.
.\" ***************************************************************************
.TP 8
.B \-version
This causes \fI\*n\fP to print a version number to the standard output,
and then exit.
.TP 8
.B \-help
This causes \fI\*n\fP to print out a verbose message describing its options,
one per line.
The message is written to the standard output.
After printing the message, \fI\*n\fP exits.
\fI\*N\fP generates this message, sorting it and noting whether
a \*(``\fB\-\fR\fIoption\fP\*(''
or a \*(``\fB+\fR\fIoption\fP\*('' turns the feature on or off,
since some features historically have been one or the other.
\fI\*N\fP generates a concise help message (multiple options per line)
when an unknown option is used, e.g.,
.NS
\fB\*n \-z\fP
.NE
.IP
If the logic for a particular option such as logging is not compiled
into \fI\*n\fP, the help text for that option also is not displayed
by the \fB\-help\fP option.
.\" ***************************************************************************
.PP
Most of the \fI\*n\fP options are actually parsed by the X Toolkit,
which sets resource values.
\fI\*N\fP provides the X Toolkit with a table of options.
A few of these are marked, telling the X Toolkit to ignore them
(\fB\-help\fP,
\fB\-version\fP,
\fB\-class\fP,
\fB\-e\fP, and
\fB\-into\fP).
After the X Toolkit has parsed the command-line parameters,
it removes those which it handles,
leaving the specially-marked parameters for \fI\*n\fP to handle.
.PP
The \fB\-version\fP and \fB\-help\fP options are interpreted even if \fI\*n\fP
cannot open the display, and are useful for testing and configuration scripts.
Along with \fB\-class\fP, they are checked before other options.
To do this, \fI\*n\fP has its own (much simpler) argument parser,
along with a table of the X Toolkit's built-in list of options.
.PP
Relying upon the X Toolkit to parse the options and associated values
has the advantages of simplicity and good integration with the X resource
mechanism.
There are a few drawbacks
.bP
\fI\*N\fP cannot tell easily whether a resource value was set by
one of the external resource- or application-defaults files,
or if it was set through the \fB\-xrm\fP option
or via some directly relevant command-line option.
\fI\*N\fP sees only the end-result:
a value supplied when creating its widgets.
.bP
\fI\*N\fP does not know the order in which particular options and
items in resource files are evaluated.
Rather, it sees all of the values for a given widget at the same time.
In the design of these options,
some are deemed more important,
and can override other options.
.IP
The X Toolkit uses patterns (constants and wildcards) to match resources.
Once a particular pattern has been used,
it will not modify it.
To override a given setting,
a more-specific pattern must be used,
e.g., replacing \*(``*\*('' with \*(``.\*(''.
Some poorly-designed resource files are too specific
to allow the command-line options to affect the relevant widget values.
.bP
In a few cases,
the X Toolkit combines its standard options in ways which do not work
well with \fI\*n\fP.
This happens with the color (\fB\-fg\fP, \fB\-B\fP) and reverse (\fB\-rv\fP)
options.
\fI\*N\fP makes a special case of these and
adjusts its sense of \*(``reverse\*(''
to lessen user surprise.
.\" ***************************************************************************
.PP
One parameter (after all options) may be given.
That overrides \fI\*n\fP's built-in choice of shell program:
.bP
If the parameter is not a relative path, i.e.,
beginning with \*(``./\*('' or \*(``../\*('',
\fI\*n\fP looks for the file in the user's PATH.
In either case, this check fails
if \fI\*n\fP cannot construct an absolute path.
.bP
If that check fails (or if no such parameter is given),
\fI\*n\fP next checks the \*(``SHELL\*('' variable.
If that specifies an executable file,
\fI\*n\fP will attempt to start that.
However, \fI\*n\fP additionally checks if it is a valid shell,
and will unset \*(``SHELL\*('' if it is not.
.bP
If \*(``SHELL\*('' is not set to an executable file,
\fI\*n\fP tries to use the shell program specified
in the user's password file entry.
As before, \fI\*n\fP verifies if this is a valid shell.
.bP
Finally, if the password file entry does not specify a valid shell,
\fI\*n\fP uses \fI/bin/sh\fP.
.PP
The \fB\-e\fP option cannot be used with this parameter since
it uses all parameters following the option.
.PP
\fI\*N\fP validates shell programs by finding their pathname in
the text file \fB/etc/shells\fP.
It treats the environment variable \*(``SHELL\*('' specially because
(like \*(``TERM\*(''), \fI\*n\fP both reads and updates the variable,
and because the program started by \fI\*n\fP is not necessarily a shell.
.\" ***************************************************************************
.PP
The other options are used to control the appearance and behavior.
Not all options are necessarily configured into your copy of \fI\*n\fP:
.TP 8
.B \-132
Normally, the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence that switches between 80 and
132 column mode is ignored.
This option causes the DECCOLM escape sequence to be recognized, and the
.I \*n
window will resize appropriately.
.TP 8
.B \-ah
This option indicates that
.I \*n
should always highlight the text cursor.
By default,
.I \*n
will display a hollow text cursor whenever the focus is lost or the
pointer leaves the window.
.TP 8
.B +ah
This option indicates that
.I \*n
should do text cursor highlighting based on focus.
.TP 8
.B \-ai
This option disables active icon support if that feature was compiled
into \fI\*n\fP.
This is equivalent to setting the \fIvt100\fP resource
\fBactiveIcon\fP to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +ai
This option enables active icon support if that feature was compiled
into \fI\*n\fP.
This is equivalent to setting the \fIvt100\fP resource
\fBactiveIcon\fP to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-aw
This option indicates that auto-wraparound should be allowed.
This
allows the cursor to automatically wrap to the beginning of the next
line when it is at the rightmost position of a line and text is
output.
.TP 8
.B +aw
This option indicates that auto-wraparound should not be allowed.
.TP 8
.BI \-b " number"
This option specifies the size of the inner border (the distance between
the outer edge of the characters and the window border) in pixels.
That is the \fIvt100\fP \fIinternalBorder\fP resource.
The
default is \*(``2\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +bc
turn off text cursor blinking.
This overrides the \fBcursorBlink\fR resource.
.TP 8
.B \-bc
turn on text cursor blinking.
This overrides the \fBcursorBlink\fR resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-bcf " milliseconds"
set the amount of time text cursor is off when blinking via the
\fIcursorOffTime\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-bcn " milliseconds"
set the amount of time text cursor is on when blinking via the
\fIcursorOnTime\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "\-bdc"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcolorBDMode\fR to \*(``false\*('',
disabling the display of characters with bold attribute as color.
.TP 8
.B "+bdc"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcolorBDMode\fR to \*(``true\*('',
enabling the display of characters with bold attribute as color
rather than bold.
.TP 8
.B "\-cb"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcutToBeginningOfLine\fP to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "+cb"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcutToBeginningOfLine\fP to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "\-cc \fIcharacterclassrange\fP:\fIvalue\fP[,...]"
This sets classes indicated by the given ranges for using in selecting by
words.
See the section specifying character classes
and discussion of the \fIcharClass\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "\-cjk_width"
Set the \fBcjkWidth\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
When turned on, characters with East Asian Ambiguous (A) category in UTR 11
have a column width of 2.
Otherwise, they have a column width of 1.
This may be useful for some legacy CJK text
terminal-based programs assuming box drawings and others to have a column
width of 2.
It also should be turned on when you specify a TrueType
CJK double-width (bi-width/monospace) font either with \fB\-fa\fP at
the command line or \fBfaceName\fP resource.
The default is \*(``false\*(''
.TP 8
.B "+cjk_width"
Reset the \fBcjkWidth\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-class " string"
This option allows you to override \fI\*n\fP's resource class.
Normally it is \*(``__default_class__\*('', but
can be set to another class such as \*(``U__default_class__\*('' to override selected resources.
.TP 8
.B "\-cm"
This option disables recognition of ANSI color-change escape sequences.
It sets the \fIcolorMode\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "+cm"
This option enables recognition of ANSI color-change escape sequences.
This is the same as the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcolorMode\fP.
.TP 8
.B "\-cn"
This option indicates that newlines should not be cut in line-mode
selections.
It sets the \fIcutNewline\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +cn
This option indicates that newlines should be cut in line-mode selections.
It sets the \fIcutNewline\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-cr " color"
This option specifies the color to use for text cursor.
The default is to
use the same foreground color that is used for text.
It sets the \fIcursorColor\fP resource according to the parameter.
.TP 8
.B \-cu
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should work around a bug in the
.IR more (1)
program that causes it
to incorrectly display lines that are exactly the width of the window and
are followed by a line beginning with a tab
(the leading tabs are not displayed).
This option is so named because it was originally thought to be a bug
in the
.IR curses (3x)
cursor motion package.
.TP 8
.B +cu
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not work around the
.IR more (1)
bug mentioned above.
.TP 8
.B "\-dc"
This option disables the escape sequence to change dynamic colors:
the vt100 foreground and background colors,
its text cursor color,
the pointer cursor foreground and background colors,
the Tektronix emulator foreground and background colors,
its text cursor color
and highlight color.
The option sets the \fIdynamicColors\fP option to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "+dc"
This option enables the escape sequence to change dynamic colors.
The option sets the \fIdynamicColors\fP option to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-e " program \fP[ \fIarguments \fP.\|.\|. ]\fI"
This option specifies the program (and its command line arguments) to be
run in the \fI\*n\fP window.
It also sets the window title and icon
name to be the basename of the program being executed if neither \fI\-T\fP
nor \fI\-n\fP are given on the command line.
\fBThis must be the last option on the command line.\fP
.TP 8
.BI \-en " encoding"
This option determines the encoding on which \fI\*n\fP runs.
It sets the \fBlocale\fR resource.
Encodings other than UTF-8 are supported by using \fIluit\fR.
The \fB\-lc\fR option should be used instead of \fB\-en\fR for
systems with locale support.
.TP 8
.BI \-fb " font"
This option specifies a font to be used when displaying bold text.
It sets the \fBboldFont\fR resource.
.IP
This font must be the same height and width as the normal font, otherwise it is ignored.
If only one of the normal or bold fonts is specified, it will be used as the
normal font and the bold font will be produced by overstriking this font.
.IP
See also the discussion of \fBboldMode\fP and \fBalwaysBoldMode\fP resources.
.TP 8
.BI \-fa " pattern"
This option sets the pattern for fonts selected from the FreeType
library if support for that library was compiled into \fI\*n\fP.
This corresponds to the \fBfaceName\fP resource.
When a CJK
double-width font is specified, you also need to turn
on the \fBcjkWidth\fP resource.
.IP
See also the \fBrenderFont\fP resource,
which combines with this to determine whether FreeType fonts are
initially active.
.TP 8
.BI \-fbb
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should compare normal and bold fonts bounding
boxes to ensure they are compatible.
It sets the \fBfreeBoldBox\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI +fbb
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not compare normal and bold fonts bounding
boxes to ensure they are compatible.
It sets the \fBfreeBoldBox\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-fbx
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not assume that the
normal and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing characters.
If any are missing, \fI\*n\fP will draw the characters directly.
It sets the \fBforceBoxChars\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI +fbx
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should assume that the
normal and bold fonts have VT100 line-drawing characters.
It sets the \fBforceBoxChars\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-fd " pattern"
This option sets the pattern for double-width fonts selected from the FreeType
library if support for that library was compiled into \fI\*n\fP.
This corresponds to the \fBfaceNameDoublesize\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-fi " font"
This option sets the font for active icons if that feature was compiled
into \fI\*n\fP.
.IP
See also the discussion of the \fBiconFont\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-fs " size"
This option sets the pointsize for fonts selected from the FreeType
library if support for that library was compiled into \fI\*n\fP.
This corresponds to the \fBfaceSize\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-fullscreen
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should ask the window manager to
let it use the full-screen for display,
e.g., without window decorations.
It sets the \fBfullscreen\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI +fullscreen
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not ask the window manager to
let it use the full-screen for display.
It sets the \fBfullscreen\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-fw \fIfont\fP
This option specifies the font to be used for displaying wide text.
By default,
it will attempt to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to
draw normal text.
If no double-width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching
the normal font.
This corresponds to the \fBwideFont\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-fwb \fIfont\fP
This option specifies the font to be used for displaying bold wide text.
By default,
it will attempt to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to
draw bold text.
If no double-width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching
the bold font.
This corresponds to the \fBwideBoldFont\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-fx \fIfont\fP
This option specifies the font to be used for displaying the preedit string
in the \*(``OverTheSpot\*('' input method.
.IP
See also the discussion of the \fBximFont\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-hc " color"
(see \fB\-selbg\fP).
.TP 8
.BI \-hf
This option indicates that HP Function Key escape codes should be generated
for function keys.
It sets the \fBhpFunctionKeys\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI +hf
This option indicates that HP Function Key escape codes should not be generated
for function keys.
It sets the \fBhpFunctionKeys\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-hm
Tells \fI\*n\fP to use
\fBhighlightTextColor\fP and \fBhighlightColor\fP
to override the reversed foreground/background colors in a selection.
It sets the \fBhighlightColorMode\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI +hm
Tells \fI\*n\fP not to use
\fBhighlightTextColor\fP and \fBhighlightColor\fP
to override the reversed foreground/background colors in a selection.
It sets the \fBhighlightColorMode\fP resource to \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.BI \-hold
Turn on the \fBhold\fP resource, i.e.,
\fI\*n\fP will not immediately destroy its window when the shell command completes.
It will wait until you use the window manager to destroy/kill the window, or
if you use the menu entries that send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL.
.TP 8
.BI +hold
Turn off the \fBhold\fP resource, i.e.,
\fI\*n\fP will immediately destroy its window when the shell command completes.
.TP 8
.B \-ie
Turn on the \fBptyInitialErase\fP resource, i.e.,
use the pseudo-terminal's sense of the \fIstty\fP erase value.
.TP 8
.B +ie
Turn off the \fBptyInitialErase\fP resource, i.e.,
set the \fIstty\fP erase value using the \fBkb\fP string from the termcap entry as
a reference, if available.
.TP 8
.B \-im
Turn on the \fBuseInsertMode\fP resource,
which forces use of insert mode by adding appropriate entries to the TERMCAP
environment variable.
(This option is ignored on most systems, because TERMCAP is not used).
.TP 8
.B +im
Turn off the \fBuseInsertMode\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-into " windowId"
Given an X window identifier (an integer, which can be hexadecimal,
octal or decimal according to whether it begins with "0x", "0" or neither),
\fI\*n\fP will reparent its top-level shell widget to that window.
This is used to embed \fI\*n\fP within other applications.

For instance, there are scripts for Tcl/Tk and Gtk which can be used
to demonstrate the feature.
When using Gtk, there is a limitation of that toolkit which requires
that \fI\*n\fP's \fBallowSendEvents\fP resource is enabled.
.TP 8
.B "\-itc"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcolorITMode\fR to \*(``false\*('',
disabling the display of characters with italic attribute as color.
.TP 8
.B "+itc"
Set the \fIvt100\fP resource \fBcolorITMode\fR to \*(``true\*('',
enabling the display of characters with italic attribute as color
rather than italic.
.TP 8
.B \-j
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should do jump scrolling.
It corresponds to the \fBjumpScroll\fP resource.
Normally,
text is scrolled one line at a time; this option allows \fI\*n\fP to move
multiple lines at a time so that it does not fall as far behind.
Its use is
strongly recommended since it makes \fI\*n\fP much faster when scanning
through large amounts of text.
The VT100 escape sequences for enabling and
disabling smooth scroll as well as the \*(``VT Options\*(''
menu can be used to turn this
feature on or off.
.TP 8
.B +j
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not do jump scrolling.
.TP 8
.B \-k8
This option sets the \fBallowC1Printable\fP resource.
When \fBallowC1Printable\fP is set, \fI\*n\fP overrides the mapping
of C1 control characters (code 128-159) to treat them as printable.
.TP 8
.B +k8
This option resets the \fBallowC1Printable\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-kt " keyboardtype"
This option sets the \fBkeyboardType\fP resource.
Possible values include:
\*(``unknown\*('',
\*(``default\*('',
\*(``hp\*('',
\*(``sco\*('',
\*(``sun\*('',
\*(``tcap\*('' and
\*(``vt220\*(''.
.IP
The value \*(``unknown\*('',
causes the corresponding resource to be ignored.
.IP
The value \*(``default\*('',
suppresses the associated resources
.BR hpFunctionKeys ,
.BR scoFunctionKeys ,
.BR sunFunctionKeys,
.BR tcapFunctionKeys
and
.BR sunKeyboard ,
using the Sun/PC keyboard layout.
.TP 8
.B \-l
Turn logging on.
Normally logging is not supported, due to security concerns.
Some versions of \fI\*n\fP may have logging enabled.
The logfile is written to the directory from which \fI\*n\fP is
invoked.
The filename is generated, of the form
.sp
	XtermLog.\fIXXXXXX\fR
.sp
or
.sp
	Xterm.log.\fIhostname.yyyy.mm.dd.hh.mm.ss.XXXXXX\fR
.sp
depending on how \fI\*n\fP was built.
.TP 8
.B +l
Turn logging off.
.TP 8
.B \-lc
Turn on support of various encodings according to the users'
locale setting, i.e., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG environment variables.
This is achieved by turning on UTF-8 mode and by invoking \fIluit\fR for
conversion between locale encodings and UTF-8.
(\fIluit\fR is not invoked in UTF-8 locales.)
This corresponds to the \fBlocale\fR resource.
.IP
The actual list of encodings which are supported is determined by \fIluit\fR.
Consult the \fIluit\fR manual page for further details.
.IP
See also the discussion of the \fB\-u8\fP option which supports UTF-8 locales.
.TP 8
.B +lc
Turn off support of automatic selection of locale encodings.
Conventional 8bit mode or, in UTF-8 locales or with \fB\-u8\fP option,
UTF-8 mode will be used.
.TP 8
.BI \-lcc " path"
File name for the encoding converter from/to locale encodings
and UTF-8 which is used with \fB\-lc\fP option or \fBlocale\fR resource.
This corresponds to the \fBlocaleFilter\fR resource.
.TP 8
.B \-leftbar
Force scrollbar to the left side of VT100 screen.
This is the default, unless you have set the rightScrollBar resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-lf " filename"
Specify the log-filename.
See the \fB\-l\fP option.
.TP 8
.B \-ls
This option indicates that the shell that is started in the \fI\*n\fP window
will be a login shell (i.e., the first character of argv[0] will be a dash,
indicating to the shell that it should read the user's .login or .profile).
.IP
The \fB\-ls\fP flag and the \fBloginShell\fP resource
are ignored if \fB\-e\fP is also given,
because \fI\*n\fP does not know how to make the shell
start the given command after whatever it does when it is a login
shell \- the user's shell of choice need not be a Bourne shell after all.
Also, \fI\*n\ \-e\fP is supposed to provide a consistent
functionality for other applications that need to start text-mode
programs in a window, and if \fBloginShell\fP were not ignored, the
result of ~/.profile might interfere with that.
.IP
If you do want the effect of \fB\-ls\fP and \fB\-e\fP simultaneously, you
may get away with something like
.NS 15
\*n \-e /bin/bash \-l \-c "my command here"
.NE
.IP
Finally, \fB\-ls\fP is not completely ignored,
because \fI\*n\ \-ls\ \-e\fP does write a \fI/etc/wtmp\fP entry
(if configured to do so),
whereas \fI\*n\ \-e\fP does not.
.TP 8
.B \-maximized
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should ask the window manager to
maximize its layout on startup.
This corresponds to the \fBmaximized\fP resource.
.IP
Maximizing is not the reverse of iconifying;
it is possible to do both with certain window managers.
.TP 8
.B +maximized
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should ask the window manager to
not maximize its layout on startup.
.TP 8
.B +ls
This option indicates that the shell that is started should not be a login
shell (i.e., it will be a normal \*(``subshell\*('').
.TP 8
.B \-mb
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should ring a margin bell when
the user types near the right end of a line.
.TP 8
.B +mb
This option indicates that margin bell should not be rung.
.TP 8
.BI \-mc " milliseconds"
This option specifies the maximum time between multi-click selections.
.TP 8
.B \-mesg
Turn off the \fBmessages\fP resource, i.e.,
disallow write access to the terminal.
.TP 8
.B +mesg
Turn on the \fBmessages\fP resource, i.e.,
allow write access to the terminal.
.TP 8
.B "\-mk_width"
Set the \fBmkWidth\fP resource to \*(``true\*(''.
This makes \fI\*n\fP use a built-in version of the wide-character width
calculation.
The default is \*(``false\*(''
.TP 8
.B "+mk_width"
Reset the \fBmkWidth\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-ms " color"
This option specifies the color to be used for the pointer cursor.
The default
is to use the foreground color.
This sets the \fIpointerColor\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-nb " number"
This option specifies the number of characters from the right end of a line
at which the margin bell, if enabled, will ring.
The default is \*(``10\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "\-nul"
This option disables the display of underlining.
.TP 8
.B "+nul"
This option enables the display of underlining.
.TP 8
.B \-pc
This option enables the PC-style use of bold colors (see boldColors
resource).
.TP 8
.B +pc
This option disables the PC-style use of bold colors.
.TP 8
.B \-pob
This option indicates that the window should be raised whenever a
Control-G is received.
.TP 8
.B +pob
This option indicates that the window should not be raised whenever a
Control-G is received.
.TP 8
.B \-report\-colors
Print a report to the standard output showing information about colors
as \fI\*n\fP allocates them.
This corresponds to the \fBreportColors\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-report\-fonts
Print a report to the standard output showing information about fonts
which are loaded.
This corresponds to the \fBreportFonts\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-rightbar
Force scrollbar to the right side of VT100 screen.
.TP 8
.B "\-rvc"
This option disables the display of characters with reverse attribute as color.
.TP 8
.B "+rvc"
This option enables the display of characters with reverse attribute as color.
.TP 8
.B \-rw
This option indicates that reverse-wraparound should be allowed.
This allows
the cursor to back up from the leftmost column of one line to the rightmost
column of the previous line.
This is very useful for editing long shell
command lines and is encouraged.
This option can be turned on and off from
the \*(``VT Options\*('' menu.
.TP 8
.B +rw
This option indicates that reverse-wraparound should not be allowed.
.TP 8
.B \-s
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP may scroll asynchronously, meaning that
the screen does not have to be kept completely up to date while scrolling.
This allows \fI\*n\fP to run faster when network latencies are very high
and is typically useful when running across a very large internet or many
gateways.
.TP 8
.B +s
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should scroll synchronously.
.TP 8
.B \-samename
Does not send title and icon name change requests when the request
would have no effect: the name is not changed.
This has the advantage
of preventing flicker and the disadvantage of requiring an extra
round trip to the server to find out the previous value.
In practice
this should never be a problem.
.TP 8
.B +samename
Always send title and icon name change requests.
.TP 8
.B \-sb
This option indicates that some number of lines that are scrolled off the top
of the window should be saved and that a scrollbar should be displayed so that
those lines can be viewed.
This option may be turned on and off from the
\*(``VT Options\*('' menu.
.TP 8
.B +sb
This option indicates that a scrollbar should not be displayed.
.TP 8
.BI \-selbg " color"
This option specifies the color to use for the background of selected text.
If not specified, reverse video is used.
See the discussion of the \fBhighlightColor\fP resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-selfg " color"
This option specifies the color to use for selected text.
If not specified, reverse video is used.
See the discussion of the \fBhighlightTextColor\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-sf
This option indicates that Sun Function Key escape codes should be generated
for function keys.
.TP 8
.B +sf
This option indicates that the standard escape codes should be generated for
function keys.
.TP 8
.BI \-sh " number"
scale line-height values by the given number.
See the discussion of the \fBscaleHeight\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-si
This option indicates that output to a window should not automatically
reposition the screen to the bottom of the scrolling region.
This option can be turned on and off from the \*(``VT Options\*('' menu.
.TP 8
.B +si
This option indicates that output to a window should cause it to
scroll to the bottom.
.TP 8
.B \-sk
This option indicates that pressing a key while
using the scrollbar to review previous lines of text should
cause the window to be repositioned automatically in the normal position at the
bottom of the scroll region.
.TP 8
.B +sk
This option indicates that pressing a key while using the scrollbar
should not cause the window to be repositioned.
.TP 8
.BI \-sl " number"
This option specifies the number of lines to save that have been scrolled
off the top of the screen.
This corresponds to the \fBsaveLines\fP resource.
The default is \*(``64\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-sm
This option, corresponding to the \fBsessionMgt\fR resource,
indicates that \fI\*n\fR should
set up session manager callbacks.
.TP 8
.B +sm
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fR should
not set up session manager callbacks.
.TP 8
.B \-sp
This option indicates that Sun/PC keyboard should be assumed,
providing mapping for keypad \*(``+\*('' to \*(``,\*('', and
CTRL-F1 to F13, CTRL-F2 to F14, etc.
.TP 8
.B +sp
This option indicates that the standard escape codes should be generated for
keypad and function keys.
.TP 8
.B \-t
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should start in Tektronix mode, rather
than in VT102 mode.
Switching between the two windows is done using the
\*(``Options\*('' menus.
.IP
Terminal database (\fIterminfo\fP (5) or \fItermcap\fP (5))
entries that work with \fI\*n\fR are:
.IP
\*(``tek4014\*('',
.br
\*(``tek4015\*('',
.br
\*(``tek4012\*('',
.br
\*(``tek4013\*('',
.br
\*(``tek4010\*('', and
.br
\*(``dumb\*(''.
.IP
.I \*n
automatically searches the terminal database in this order for these entries and then
sets the \*(``TERM\*('' and the \*(``TERMCAP\*('' environment variables.
.TP 8
.B +t
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should start in VT102 mode.
.TP 8
.B \-tb
This option, corresponding to the \fBtoolBar\fR resource,
indicates that \fI\*n\fR should display a toolbar (or menubar)
at the top of its window.
The buttons in the toolbar correspond to
the popup menus, e.g., control/left/mouse for \*(``Main Options\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +tb
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fR should
not set up a toolbar.
.TP 8
.BI \-ti " term_id"
Specify the name used by \fI\*n\fP to select the
correct response to terminal ID queries.
It also specifies the emulation level,
used to determine the type of response to a DA control sequence.
Valid values include vt52, vt100, vt101, vt102, vt220, and vt240
(the \*(``vt\*('' is optional).
The default is \*(``vt__default_termid__\*(''.
The term_id argument specifies the terminal ID to use.
(This is the same as the \fBdecTerminalID\fP resource).
.TP 8
.BI \-tm " string"
This option specifies a series of terminal setting keywords followed by the
characters that should be bound to those functions, similar to the \fIstty\fP
program.
The keywords and their values are described in detail in the \fBttyModes\fP
resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-tn " name"
This option specifies the name of the terminal type to be set in the TERM
environment variable.
It corresponds to the \fBtermName\fP resource.
This terminal type must exist in the terminal
database
(termcap or terminfo, depending on how \fI\*n\fP is built)
and should have \fIli#\fP and \fIco#\fP entries.
If the terminal type is not found, \fI\*n\fP uses the built-in list
\*(``xterm\*('', \*(``vt102\*('', etc.
.TP 8
.B \-u8
This option sets the \fButf8\fP resource.
When \fButf8\fP is set, \fI\*n\fP interprets incoming data as UTF-8.
This sets the \fBwideChars\fP resource as a side-effect,
but the UTF-8 mode set by this option prevents it from being turned off.
If you must turn UTF-8 encoding on and off,
use the \fB\-wc\fP option or the corresponding \fBwideChars\fP resource,
rather than the \fB\-u8\fP option.
.IP
This option and the \fButf8\fR resource are overridden by
the \fB\-lc\fP and \fB\-en\fP options and \fBlocale\fR resource.
That is, if \fI\*n\fP has been compiled to support \fIluit\fR,
and the \fBlocale\fP resource is not \*(``false\*(''
this option is ignored.
We recommend using
the \fB\-lc\fR option or the \*(``\fBlocale:\ true\fR\*('' resource
in UTF-8 locales when your operating system supports locale,
or \fB\-en\ UTF-8\fP option or the \*(``\fBlocale:\ UTF-8\fR\*('' resource
when your operating system does not support locale.
.TP 8
.B +u8
This option resets the \fButf8\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "\-uc"
This option makes the cursor underlined instead of a box.
.TP 8
.B "+uc"
This option makes the cursor a box instead of underlined.
.TP 8
.B "\-ulc"
This option disables the display of characters with underline attribute as
color rather than with underlining.
.TP 8
.B "+ulc"
This option enables the display of characters with underline attribute as
color rather than with underlining.
.TP 8
.B "\-ulit"
This option, corresponding to the \fBitalicULMode\fP resource,
disables the display of characters with underline attribute as
italics rather than with underlining.
.TP 8
.B "+ulit"
This option, corresponding to the \fBitalicULMode\fP resource,
enables the display of characters with underline attribute as
italics rather than with underlining.
.TP 8
.B \-ut
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not write a record into the
the system \fIutmp\fP log file.
.TP 8
.B +ut
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should write a record into
the system \fIutmp\fP log file.
.TP 8
.B \-vb
This option indicates that a visual bell is preferred over an audible one.
Instead of ringing the terminal bell whenever a Control-G is received, the
window will be flashed.
.TP 8
.B +vb
This option indicates that a visual bell should not be used.
.TP 8
.B \-wc
This option sets the \fBwideChars\fP resource.
.IP
When \fBwideChars\fP is set,
\fI\*n\fP maintains internal structures for 16-bit characters.
If \fI\*n\fP is not started in UTF-8 mode (or if this resource is not set),
initially it maintains those structures to support 8-bit characters.
\fI\*N\fP can later be switched,
using a menu entry or control sequence,
causing it to reallocate those structures to support 16-bit characters.
.IP
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B +wc
This option resets the \fBwideChars\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B \-wf
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should wait for the window to be mapped
the first time before starting the subprocess so that the initial terminal
size settings and environment variables are correct.
It is the application's
responsibility to catch subsequent terminal size changes.
.TP 8
.B +wf
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should not wait before starting the
subprocess.
.TP 8
.B \-ziconbeep \fIpercent\fP
Same as \fBzIconBeep\fP resource.
If percent is non-zero, xterms that produce output while iconified
will cause an XBell sound at the given volume
and have \*(``***\*('' prepended to their icon titles.
Most window managers will detect this change immediately, showing you
which window has the output.
(A similar feature was in x10 \fI\*n\fP.)
.TP 8
.B \-C
This option indicates that this window should receive console output.
This
is not supported on all systems.
To obtain console output, you must be the
owner of the console device, and you must have read and write permission
for it.
If you are running X under \fIxdm\fP on the console screen you may
need to have the session startup and reset programs explicitly change the
ownership of the console device in order to get this option to work.
.TP 8
.B \-S\fIccn\fP
This option allows \fI\*n\fP to be used as an input and
output channel for an existing program and is sometimes used in specialized
applications.
The option value specifies the last few letters of the name of a pseudo-terminal
to use in slave mode, plus the number of the inherited file descriptor.
If the option contains a \*(``/\*('' character, that delimits the characters
used for the pseudo-terminal name from the file descriptor.
Otherwise, exactly two characters are used from the option for
the pseudo-terminal name, the remainder is the file descriptor.
Examples
(the first two are equivalent
since the descriptor follows the last \*(``/\*(''):
.NS 15
-S/dev/pts/123/45
-S123/45
-Sab34
.NE
.IP
Note that \fI\*n\fP does not close any file descriptor
which it did not open for its own use.
It is possible (though probably not portable) to have an application
which passes an open file descriptor down to \fI\*n\fP past the
initialization or the \fB\-S\fP option to a process running in the \fI\*n\fP.
.SS Old Options
.PP
The following command line arguments are provided for compatibility with
older versions.
They may not be supported in the next release as the X
Toolkit provides standard options that accomplish the same task.
.TP 8
.B "%\fIgeom\fP"
This option specifies the preferred size and position of the Tektronix window.
It is shorthand for specifying the \*(``\fI*tekGeometry\fP\*('' resource.
.TP 8
.B "#\fIgeom\fP"
This option specifies the preferred position of the icon window.
It is shorthand for specifying the \*(``\fI*iconGeometry\fP\*('' resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-T " string"
This option specifies the title for \fI\*n\fP's windows.
It is equivalent to \fB\-title\fP.
.TP 8
.BI \-n " string"
This option specifies the icon name for \fI\*n\fP's windows.
It is shorthand for specifying the \*(``\fI*iconName\fP\*('' resource.
Note that this is not the same as the toolkit option \fB\-name\fP (see below).
The default icon name is the application name.
.IP
If no suitable icon is found, \fI\*n\fP provides a compiled-in pixmap.
.TP 8
.B \-r
This option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by swapping
the foreground and background colors.
It is equivalent to
\fB\-rv\fP.
.TP 8
.BI \-w " number"
This option specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding the window.
It is equivalent to \fB\-borderwidth\fP or \fB\-bw\fP.
.
.SS X Toolkit Options
.PP
The following standard X Toolkit command line arguments are commonly used
with \fI\*n\fP:
.TP 8
.B \-bd \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color to use for the border of the window.
The corresponding resource name is \fIborderColor\fP.
\fI\*N\fP uses the X Toolkit default, which is \*(``XtDefaultForeground\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-bg \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color to use for the background of the window.
The corresponding resource name is \fIbackground\fP.
The default is \*(``XtDefaultBackground\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-bw \fInumber\fP
This option specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding the window.
.IP
This appears to be a legacy of older X releases.
It sets the \fBborderWidth\fP resource of the shell widget,
and may provide advice to your window manager to set the thickness of the
window frame.
Most window managers do not use this information.
See the \fB\-b\fP option, which controls the inner border of the \fI\*n\fP
window.
.TP 8
.B \-display \fIdisplay\fP
This option specifies the X server to contact; see \fIX(__miscmansuffix__)\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-fg \fIcolor\fP
This option specifies the color to use for displaying text.
The corresponding resource name is \fIforeground\fP.
The default is
\*(``XtDefaultForeground\*(''.
.TP 8
.B \-fn \fIfont\fP
This option specifies the font to be used for displaying normal text.
The corresponding resource name is \fIfont\fP.
The resource value default is \fIfixed\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-font \fIfont\fP
This is the same as \fB\-fn\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-geometry \fIgeometry\fP
This option specifies the preferred size and position of the VT102 window;
see \fIX(__miscmansuffix__)\fP.
.IP
The normal geometry specification can be suffixed with \fB@\fP followed by a
Xinerama screen specification; it can be either \fBg\fP for the global
screen (default), \fBc\fP for the current screen or a screen number.
.TP 8
.B \-iconic
This option indicates that \fI\*n\fP should ask the window manager to
start it as an icon rather than as the normal window.
The corresponding resource name is \fIiconic\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-name \fIname\fP
This option specifies the application name under which resources are to be
obtained, rather than the default executable file name.
\fIName\fP should not contain \*(``.\*('' or \*(``*\*('' characters.
.TP 8
.B \-rv
This option indicates that reverse video should be simulated by swapping
the foreground and background colors.
The corresponding resource name is \fIreverseVideo\fP.
.TP 8
.B +rv
Disable the simulation of reverse video by swapping foreground and background
colors.
.TP 8
.B \-title \fIstring\fP
This option specifies the window title string, which may be displayed by
window managers if the user so chooses.
The default title is the command
line specified after the \fB\-e\fP option, if any, otherwise the application
name.
.TP 8
.B \-xrm \fIresourcestring\fP
This option specifies a resource string to be used.
This is especially
useful for setting resources that do not have separate command line options.

If true,
\fI\*n\fP will not immediately destroy its window when the shell command completes.
It will wait until you use the window manager to destroy/kill the window, or
if you use the menu entries that send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL.

.B "iconGeometry (\fPclass\fB IconGeometry)"
Specifies the preferred size and position of the application when iconified.

Specifies an icon which will be added to the window manager hints.
\fI\*N\fP provides no default value.
.IP
Set this resource to \*(``none\*('' to omit the hint entirely,
using whatever the window manager may decide.
.IP
If the \fBiconHint\fP resource is given (or is set via the \fB\-n\fP option)
\fI\*n\fP searches for a pixmap file with that name,
in the current directory as well as in __pixmapsdir__.
if the resource does not specify an absolute pathname.
In each case, \fI\*n\fP adds \*(``_48x48\*(''
and/or \*(``.xpm\*('' to the filename
after trying without those suffixes.
If it is able to load the file, \fI\*n\fP sets the window manager
hint for the icon-pixmap.
These pixmaps are distributed with \fI\*n\fP, and can optionally be

.TP 8
.B "sameName (\fPclass\fB SameName)"
If the value of this resource is \*(``true\*('', \fI\*n\fP does not send
title and icon name change requests when the request

While this resource applies to either bitmap or TrueType fonts,
its main purpose is to

\fI\*N\fP checks the font metrics to find what the library claims are
the bounding boxes for each glyph (character).
However, some of Xft's features (such as the autohinter) can cause the

.IP
See also the \fBkeyboardType\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "sunKeyboard (\fPclass\fB SunKeyboard)"
Specifies whether or not Sun/PC keyboard layout should be assumed rather
than DEC VT220.
This causes the keypad \*(``+\*('' to be mapped to \*(``,\*(''.
and
CTRL F1-F10 to F11-F20, depending on the setting of the \fBctrlFKeys\fP
resource, so \fI\*n\fP emulates a DEC VT220 more accurately.
Otherwise (the default, with \fBsunKeyboard\fP set to \*(``false\*(''),
\fI\*n\fP uses PC-style bindings for the function keys and keypad.
.IP
PC-style bindings
use the Shift, Alt, Control and Meta keys as modifiers for function-keys
and keypad
(see the document \fIXterm Control Sequences\fP for details).
The PC-style bindings are analogous to PCTerm, but not the same thing.
Normally these bindings do not conflict with the use of the Meta key
as described for the \fBeightBitInput\fP resource.
If they do, note that the PC-style bindings are evaluated first.
.IP
See also the \fBkeyboardType\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "tcapFunctionKeys (\fPclass\fB TcapFunctionKeys)"

eol,
eol2,
erase,
erase2,
flush,
intr,
kill,
lnext,
quit,
rprnt,
start,
status,
stop,
susp,
swtch and
weras.
Control characters may be specified as ^char (e.g., ^c or ^u)
and \fB^?\fP may be used to indicate delete (127).
Use \fB^\-\fP to denote \fIundef\fP.
Use \fB\\034\fP to represent \fB^\\\fP, since a literal backslash in
an X resource escapes the next character.
.IP
This is very useful for overriding
the default terminal settings without having to do an \fIstty\fP every time
an \fI\*n\fP is started.
Note, however, that the \fIstty\fP program on a given host may use different
keywords; \fI\*n\fR's table is built-in.
.IP
If the \fBttyModes\fP resource specifies a value for \fBerase\fP,
that overrides the \fBptyInitialErase\fP resource setting,
i.e., \fI\*n\fP initializes the terminal to match that value.
.TP 8
.B "useInsertMode (\fPclass\fB UseInsertMode)"
Force use of insert mode by adding appropriate entries to the TERMCAP
environment variable.
This is useful if the system termcap is broken.
(This resource is ignored on most systems, because TERMCAP is not used).
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "utmpDisplayId (\fPclass\fB UtmpDisplayId)"

identifier (display number and screen number) as well as the hostname in
the system \fIutmp\fP log file.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8

If true, \fI\*n\fP will not try.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "waitForMap (\fPclass\fB WaitForMap)"
Specifies whether or not \fI\*n\fP should wait for the initial window map
before starting the subprocess.
This is part of the
.B ptyHandshake
logic.
When \fI\*n\fP is directed to wait in this fashion,
it passes the terminal size from the display end of the pseudo-terminal
to the terminal I/O connection, e.g.,
using the size according to the window manager.
Otherwise, it uses the size as given in resource values or command-line
option \fB\-geom\fP.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "zIconBeep (\fPclass\fB ZIconBeep)"
Same as \-ziconbeep command line argument.
If the value of this resource is non-zero, xterms that produce output
while iconified will cause an XBell sound at the given volume
and have \*(``***\ \*('' prepended to their icon titles.
Most window managers will detect this change immediately, showing you
which window has the output.
(A similar feature was in x10 \fI\*n\fR.)
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "zIconTitleFormat (\fPclass\fB ZIconTitleFormat)"
Allow customization of the string used in the \fBzIconBeep\fP feature.
The default value is \*(``***\ %s\*(''.
.IP
If the resource value contains a \*(``%s\*('',
then \fI\*n\fP inserts the icon title at that point rather
than prepending the string to the icon title.
(Only the first \*(``%s\*('' is used).

.SS VT100 Widget Resources
.PP
The following resources are specified as part
of the \fIvt100\fP widget (class \fIVT100\fP).
They are specified by patterns such as \*(``\fB__default_class__.vt100.\fP\fINAME\fP\*(''.
.PP
If your \fI\*n\fP is configured to support the \*(``toolbar\*('', then those
patterns need an extra level for the form-widget which holds the
toolbar and vt100 widget.
A wildcard between the top-level
\*(``__default_class__\*('' and the \*(``vt100\*('' widget makes the resource settings work for
either, e.g., \*(``\fB__default_class__*vt100.\fP\fINAME\fP\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "activeIcon (\fPclass\fB ActiveIcon)"
Specifies whether or not active icon windows are to be used when the
\fI\*n\fP window is iconified, if this feature is compiled into \fI\*n\fR.
The active icon is a miniature representation of the content of the
window and will update as the content changes.
Not all window managers necessarily support application icon windows.
Some window managers
will allow you to enter keystrokes into the active icon window.
The default is \*(``default\*(''.
.IP
\fI\*N\fP accepts either a keyword (ignoring case)

If true, allow control characters such as BEL and CAN to be pasted.
Formatting characters (tab, newline) are always allowed.
Other C0 control characters are suppressed unless this resource is enabled.

.TP 8
.B "allowScrollLock (\fPclass\fB AllowScrollLock)"
Specifies whether control sequences that set/query
the Scroll Lock key should be allowed,
as well as whether the Scroll Lock key responds to user's keypress.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.IP
When this feature is enabled, \fI\*n\fP will sense the state of the
Scroll Lock key each time it acquires focus.
Pressing the Scroll Lock key toggles \fI\*n\fP's internal state,
as well as toggling the associated LED.
While the Scroll Lock is active, \fI\*n\fP attempts to keep a viewport on the
same set of lines.
If the current viewport is scrolled past the limit set by the
\fBsaveLines\fP resource, then Scroll Lock has no further effect.
.IP
The reason for setting the default to \*(``false\*('' is to avoid
user surprise.
This key is generally unused in keyboard configurations,
and has not acquired a standard meaning even when it is used in that manner.
Consequently, users have assigned it for ad hoc purposes.
.TP 8
.B "allowSendEvents (\fPclass\fB AllowSendEvents)"
Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button events (generated using
the X protocol SendEvent request) should be interpreted or discarded.
The default is \*(``false\*('' meaning they are discarded.

.bP
\fI\*N\fP can tell the querying program what strings are sent by modified

in that special case.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "answerbackString (\fPclass\fB AnswerbackString)"
Specifies the string that \fI\*n\fR sends in response to an ENQ (control/E)
character from the host.
The default is a blank string, i.e., \*(``\*(''.
A hardware VT100 implements this feature as a setup option.
.TP 8

If \*(``true\*('', the keypad keys are initially in application mode.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "assumeAllChars (\fPclass\fB AssumeAllChars)"
If \*(``true\*('', this enables a special case in bitmap fonts to
allow the font server to choose how to display missing glyphs.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.IP
The reason for this resource is to help with
certain quasi-automatically generated fonts
(such as the ISO-10646-1 encoding of Terminus)
which have incorrect font-metrics.
.TP 8
.B "autoWrap (\fPclass\fB AutoWrap)"
Specifies whether or not auto-wraparound should be enabled.
This is the same as the VT102 DECAWM.
The
default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "awaitInput (\fPclass\fB AwaitInput)"
Specifies whether or not \fI\*n\fR uses a 50 millisecond timeout to
await input (i.e., to support the Xaw3d arrow scrollbar).
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "backarrowKey (\fPclass\fB BackarrowKey)"
Specifies whether the backarrow key transmits
a backspace (8)
or delete (127) character.
This corresponds to the DECBKM control sequence.
A \*(``true\*('' value specifies backspace.
The default is \*(``__backarrow_is_bs__\*(''.
Pressing the control key toggles this behavior.
.TP 8
.B "background (\fPclass\fB Background)"
Specifies the color to use for the background of the window.
The default is
\*(``XtDefaultBackground\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "bellIsUrgent (\fPclass\fB BellIsUrgent)"
Specifies whether to set the Urgency hint for the window manager
when making a bell sound.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "bellOnReset (\fPclass\fB BellOnReset)"
Specifies whether to sound a bell when doing a hard reset.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "bellSuppressTime (\fPclass\fB BellSuppressTime)"
Number of milliseconds after a bell command is sent during which additional
bells will be suppressed.
Default is 200.
If set non-zero,
additional bells
will also be suppressed until the server reports that processing of
the first bell has been completed; this feature is most useful with
the visible bell.
.TP 8
.B "boldColors (\fPclass\fB ColorMode)"
Specifies whether to combine bold attribute with colors like the IBM PC,
i.e., map colors 0 through 7 to colors 8 through 15.
These normally are the brighter versions of the first 8 colors, hence bold.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "boldFont (\fPclass\fB BoldFont)"
Specifies the name of the bold font to use instead of overstriking.
There is no default for this resource.
.IP
This font must be the same height and width as the normal font, otherwise it is ignored.
If only one of the normal or bold fonts is specified, it will be used as the
normal font and the bold font will be produced by overstriking this font.
.IP
See also the discussion of \fBboldMode\fP and \fBalwaysBoldMode\fP resources.
.TP 8
.B "boldMode (\fPclass\fB BoldMode)"
This specifies whether or not text with the bold attribute should be
overstruck to simulate bold fonts if the resolved bold font is the
same as the normal font.
It may be desirable to disable bold fonts when color is being
used for the bold attribute.
.IP
Note that \fI\*n\fP has one bold font which you may set explicitly.
\fI\*N\fP attempts to derive a bold font for the other font selections
(\fBfont1\fP through \fBfont6\fP).
If it cannot find a bold font, it will use the normal font.
In each case (whether the explicit resource or the derived font),
if the normal and bold fonts are distinct, this resource has no effect.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.IP
See the \fBalwaysBoldMode\fP resource which can modify the behavior
of this resource.
.IP
Although \fI\*n\fP attempts to derive a bold font for other font selections,
the font server may not cooperate.
Since X11R6, bitmap fonts have been scaled.
The font server claims to provide the bold font that \fI\*n\fP requests,
but the result is not always readable.
XFree86 introduced a feature which can be used to suppress the scaling.
In the X server's configuration file (e.g., \*(``/etc/X11/XFree86\*(''
or \*(``/etc/X11/xorg.conf\*(''), you
can add \*(``:unscaled\*('' to the end of the directory specification for the
\*(``misc\*('' fonts,
which comprise the fixed-pitch fonts that are used by \fI\*n\fP.
For example
.NS
FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"
.NE
.IP
would become
.NS
FontPath	"/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/:unscaled"
.NE
.IP
Depending on your configuration, the font server may have its own configuration
file.
The same \*(``:unscaled\*('' can be added to its configuration file at the
end of the directory specification for \*(``misc\*(''.
.IP
The bitmap scaling feature is also used by \fI\*n\fP to implement
VT102 double-width and double-height characters.
.TP 8
.B "brokenLinuxOSC (\fPclass\fB BrokenLinuxOSC)"
If true, \fI\*n\fP applies a workaround to ignore malformed control
sequences that a Linux script might send.
Compare the palette control sequences documented in \fIconsole_codes\fR
with ECMA-48.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "brokenSelections (\fPclass\fB BrokenSelections)"
If true, \fI\*n\fP in 8-bit mode will interpret
.B STRING
selections as carrying text in the current locale's encoding.
Normally
.B STRING
selections carry ISO-8859-1 encoded text.
Setting this resource to
\*(``true\*('' violates the ICCCM; it may, however, be useful for interacting
with some broken X clients.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "brokenStringTerm (\fPclass\fB BrokenStringTerm)"
provides a work-around for some ISDN routers which start an application
control string without completing it.
Set this to \*(``true\*('' if \fI\*n\fP appears to freeze when connecting.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.IP
\fI\*N\fP's state parser recognizes
several types of control strings which can contain text, e.g.,
.sp
.RS
\fBAPC\fP (Application Program Command),
.br
\fBDCS\fP (Device Control String),
.br
\fBOSC\fP (Operating System Command),
.br
\fBPM\fP (Privacy Message), and
.br
\fBSOS\fP (Start of String),
.RE
.IP
Each should end with a string-terminator (a special character which
cannot appear in these strings).
Ordinary control characters found within the string are not ignored;
they are processed without interfering with the process of accumulating
the control string's content.
\fI\*N\fP recognizes these controls in all modes,
although some of the functions may be suppressed after parsing the control.
.IP
When enabled, this feature allows the user to exit from an unterminated
control string when any of these ordinary control characters are found:
.sp
.RS
control/D (used as an end of file in many shells),
.br
control/H (backspace),
.br
control/I (tab-feed),
.br
control/J (line feed aka newline),
.br
control/K (vertical tab),
.br
control/L (form feed),
.br
control/M (carriage return),
.br
control/N (shift-out),
.br
control/O (shift-in),
.br
control/Q (XOFF),
.br
control/X (cancel)
.RE
.TP 8
.B "c132 (\fPclass\fB C132)"
Specifies whether or not the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence,
used to switch between 80 and 132 columns, should be honored.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "cacheDoublesize (\fPclass\fB CacheDoublesize)"
Tells whether to cache double-sized fonts by \fI\*n\fR.
Set this to zero to disable double-sized fonts altogether.
.TP 8
.B "cdXtraScroll (\fPclass\fB CdXtraScroll)"
Specifies whether \fI\*n\fP should scroll to a new page when clearing
the whole screen.
Like \fBtiXtraScroll\fP,
the intent of this option is to provide a picture of the full-screen
application's display on the scrollback before wiping out the text.
The default for this resource is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "charClass (\fPclass\fB CharClass)"
Specifies comma-separated lists of character class bindings of the form
[\fIlow\fP-]\fIhigh\fP:\fIvalue\fP.
These are used in determining which
sets of characters should be treated the same when doing cut and paste.
See the \fBCHARACTER CLASSES\fP section.
.TP 8
.B "cjkWidth (\fPclass\fB CjkWidth)"
Specifies whether \fI\*n\fP should follow
the traditional East Asian width convention.
When turned on, characters with East Asian Ambiguous (A) category in UTR
11 have a column width of 2.
You may have to set this option to \*(``true\*(''
if you have some old East Asian terminal based programs that assume that
line-drawing characters have a column width of 2.
If this resource is false, the \fBmkWidth\fP resource controls the
choice between the system's \fBwcwidth\fP and \fI\*n\fP's built-in tables.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.

The defaults are,
respectively,
black,
red3,
green3,

.TP 8
.B "color16 (\fPclass\fB Color16)"
.TP 8
through
.TP 8
.B "color255 (\fPclass\fB Color255)"
These specify the colors for the 256-color extension.
The default resource values
are for colors 16 through 231 to make a 6x6x6 color cube, and colors
232 through 255 to make a grayscale ramp.
.IP
Resources past \fBcolor15\fP are available as a compile-time option.
Due to a hardcoded limit in the X libraries on the total number of
resources (to 400), the resources for 256-colors
are omitted when wide-character support and \fIluit\fP are enabled.
Besides inconsistent behavior if only part of the resources were allowed,
determining the exact cutoff is difficult, and the X libraries tend
to crash if the number of resources exceeds the limit.
The color palette is still initialized to the same default values,
and can be modified via control sequences.
.IP
On the other hand, the resource limit does permit including the entire
range for 88-colors.
.TP 8
.B "colorAttrMode (\fPclass\fB ColorAttrMode)"
Specifies whether \fBcolorBD\fP, \fBcolorBL\fP, \fBcolorRV\fP, and
\fBcolorUL\fP should override ANSI colors.
If not, these are displayed only when no ANSI colors
have been set for the corresponding position.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "colorBD (\fPclass\fB ColorBD)"
This specifies the color to use to display bold characters if
the \*(``colorBDMode\*('' resource is enabled.
The default is \*(``XtDefaultForeground\*(''.
.IP
See also the \fBveryBoldColors\fP resource which allows combining bold and color.
.TP 8
.B "colorBDMode (\fPclass\fB ColorAttrMode)"
Specifies whether characters with the bold attribute should be displayed in
color or as bold characters.
Note that setting \fBcolorMode\fR off disables
all colors, including bold.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "colorBL (\fPclass\fB ColorBL)"
This specifies the color to use to display blink characters if
the \*(``colorBLMode\*('' resource is enabled.
The default is \*(``XtDefaultForeground\*(''.
.IP
See also the \fBveryBoldColors\fP resource which allows combining underline and color.
.TP 8
.B "colorBLMode (\fPclass\fB ColorAttrMode)"
Specifies whether characters with the blink attribute should be displayed in

Note that setting \fBcolorMode\fR off disables all colors, including this.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "colorIT (\fPclass\fB ColorIT)"
This specifies the color to use to display italic characters if

This specifies the color to use to display reverse characters if
the \*(``colorRVMode\*('' resource is enabled.
The default is \*(``XtDefaultForeground\*(''.
.IP
See also the \fBveryBoldColors\fP resource which allows combining reverse and color.
.TP 8

the \*(``colorULMode\*('' resource is enabled.
The default is \*(``XtDefaultForeground\*(''.
.IP
See also the \fBveryBoldColors\fP resource which allows combining underline and color.
.TP 8

Note that setting \fBcolorMode\fR off
disables all colors, including underlining.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "combiningChars (\fPclass\fB CombiningChars)"
Specifies the number of wide-characters which can be stored in a cell
to overstrike (combine) with the base character of the cell.
This can be set to values in the range 0 to 4.
The default is \*(``2\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "ctrlFKeys (\fPclass\fB CtrlFKeys)"
In VT220 keyboard mode (see \fBsunKeyboard\fP resource),
specifies the amount by which to shift F1-F12 given a control modifier (CTRL).
This allows you to generate key symbols for F10-F20 on a Sun/PC keyboard.
The default is \*(``10\*('', which means that CTRL F1 generates the key
symbol for F11.
.TP 8
.B "curses (\fPclass\fB Curses)"
Specifies whether or not the last column bug in
.IR more (1)
should be worked around.
See the \fB\-cu\fP option for details.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "cursorBlink (\fPclass\fB CursorBlink)"
Specifies whether to make the cursor blink.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.IP
\fI\*N\fP uses two variables to determine whether the cursor blinks.
One is set by this resource.
The other is set by control sequences (private mode 12 and DECSCUSR).
\fI\*N\fP tests the XOR of the two variables.
.TP 8
.B "cursorColor (\fPclass\fB CursorColor)"
Specifies the color to use for the text cursor.
The default is \*(``XtDefaultForeground\*(''.
By default,
\fI\*n\fP attempts to keep this color from being the same as the background
color, since it draws the cursor by filling the background of a text cell.
The same restriction applies to control sequences which may change this color.
.IP
Setting this resource overrides
most of \fI\*n\fP's adjustments to cursor color.
It will still use reverse-video to disallow some cases, such as a black
cursor on a black background.
.TP 8
.B "cursorOffTime (\fPclass\fB CursorOffTime)"
Specifies the duration of the \*(``off\*('' part of the cursor blink cycle-time
in milliseconds.
The same timer is used for text blinking.
The default is \*(``300\*(''.
.TP 8

The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "cutToBeginningOfLine (\fPclass\fB CutToBeginningOfLine)"
If \*(``false\*('', triple clicking to select a line selects only from the
current word forward.
If \*(``true\*('', the entire line is selected.
The default is \*(``true\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "decTerminalID (\fPclass\fB DecTerminalID)"
Specifies the emulation level (100=VT100, 220=VT220, etc.), used to determine
the type of response to a DA control sequence.
Leading non-digit characters are ignored,
e.g., \*(``vt100\*('' and \*(``100\*('' are the same.
The default is \*(``__default_termid__\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "defaultString (\fPclass\fB DefaultString)"
Specify the character (or string) which \fI\*n\fP will substitute when
pasted text includes a character which cannot be represented in the
current encoding.
For instance, pasting UTF-8 text into a display of ISO-8859-1 characters
will only be able to display codes 0-255, while UTF-8 text can include
Unicode values above 255.
The default is \*(``#\*('' (a single pound sign).
.IP
If the undisplayable text would be double-width,
\fI\*n\fP will add a space after the \*(``#\*('' character, to give roughly
the same layout on the screen as the original text.
.TP 8
.B "deleteIsDEL (\fPclass\fB DeleteIsDEL)"

Note that the \fIAlt\fP key is not necessarily the same as the
\fIMeta\fP modifier.
The \fIxmodmap\fP utility lists your key modifiers.
X defines modifiers for shift, (caps) lock and control,
as well as 5 additional modifiers which are generally used to configure
key modifiers.
\fI\*N\fP inspects the same information to find the modifier associated
with either \fIMeta\fP key (left or right),
and uses that key as the \fIMeta\fP modifier.
It also looks for the NumLock key,
to recognize the modifier which is associated with that.
.IP
If your \fIxmodmap\fP configuration
uses the same keycodes for Alt- and Meta-keys,
\fI\*n\fP will only see the Alt-key definitions, since those are tested
before Meta-keys.
NumLock is tested first.

and \fBrmm\fP (reset meta mode)
have been recognized by \fIbash\fP for some time.
Interestingly enough, \fIbash\fP's notion of \*(``meta mode\*(''
differs from the standard definition (in the \fIterminfo\fP manual),
which describes the change to the eighth bit of a character.
It happens that \fIbash\fP views \*(``meta mode\*(''
as the ESC character that \fI\*n\fP puts before a character when a
special meta key is pressed.
\fIbash\fP's early documentation talks about the ESC character
and ignores the eighth bit.

There is no default value.
.IP
If not specified,

.B "faceSize (\fPclass\fB FaceSize)"
Specify the pointsize for fonts selected from the FreeType
library if support for that library was compiled into \fI\*n\fR.
The default is \*(``14.0\*(''
On the \fBVT\ Fonts\fP menu, this corresponds to the \fIDefault\fP entry.
.IP
Although the default is \*(``14.0\*('',
this may not be the same as the pointsize for the default bitmap font,
i.e., that assigned with the \fB\-fn\fP option,
or the \fBfont\fP resource.
For example, the \*(``fixed\*('' font usually has a pointsize of \*(``8.0\*(''.
If you set \fBfaceSize\fP to match the size of the bitmap font,
then switching between bitmap and TrueType fonts via the font menu
will give comparable sizes for the window.
.IP
You can specify the pointsize for TrueType fonts selected with the other
size-related menu entries such as Medium, Huge, etc., by using one of
the following resource values.
If you do not specify a value,
they default to \*(``0.0\*('',
which causes \fI\*n\fP to use the ratio of font sizes
from the corresponding bitmap
font resources to obtain a TrueType pointsize.
.IP
If all of the \fBfaceSize\fP resources are set, then \fI\*n\fP
will use this information to determine the next smaller/larger
TrueType font for the
\fBlarger-vt-font()\fP and
\fBsmaller-vt-font()\fP actions.
If any are not set, \fI\*n\fP will use only the areas of the bitmap fonts.

The fixed-pitch ISO-8859-*-encoded fonts used by \fI\*n\fP
normally have the VT100 line-drawing glyphs in cells 1-31.
Other fixed-pitch fonts may be more attractive, but lack these glyphs.

\fI\*N\fP stores data as it is shown on the screen.
Erasing the display changes the internal state of each cell

Regardless of your locale and encoding,
you need an ISO-10646-1 font to display the result.
Your configuration may not include this font,

That is,
resource patterns such as \*(``\fB*vt100.utf8Fonts.font\fP\*('' will be loaded,
and (if this resource is enabled), override the normal fonts.
If no subresources are found,
the normal fonts such as \*(``\fB*vt100.font\fP\*('', etc., are used.

\fBSouthWest\fP (the default) specifies that
the bottom line of text on the screen stay fixed.
If the window is
made taller, additional saved lines will be scrolled down onto the
screen; if the window is made shorter, lines will be scrolled off the
top of the screen, and the top saved lines will be dropped.
.TP 8
.B "retryInputMethod (\fPclass\fB XtCRetryInputMethod)"
Tells \fI\*n\fP how many times to retry,
in case the input-method server is not responding.
This is a different issue than unsupported preedit type, etc.
You may encounter retries if your X configuration (and its libraries)
are missing pieces.
Setting this resource to zero ``0'' will cancel the retrying.
The default is ``3''.
.TP 8
.B "reverseVideo (\fPclass\fB ReverseVideo)"
Specifies whether or not reverse video should be simulated.
The default is
\*(``false\*(''.
.IP
There are several aspects to reverse video in \fI\*n\fP:
.RS
.bP
The command-line \fB\-rv\fP option tells the X libraries to reverse
the foreground and background colors.
\fI\*N\fP's command-line options set resource values.
In particular, the X Toolkit sets the \fBreverseVideo\fP resource
when the \fB\-rv\fP option is used.
.bP
If the user has also used command-line options \fB\-fg\fP or \fB\-bg\fP
to set the foreground and background colors,
\fI\*n\fP does not see these options directly.
Instead,
it examines the resource values to reconstruct the command-line options,
and determine which of the colors is the user's intended foreground, etc.
Their actual values are irrelevant to the reverse video function;
some users prefer the X defaults (black text on a white background),
others prefer white text on a black background.
.bP
After startup,
the user can toggle the \*(``Enable Reverse Video\*('' menu entry.
This exchanges the current foreground and background colors
of the VT100 widget,
and repaints the screen.
Because of the X resource hierarchy,
the \fBreverseVideo\fP resource applies to more than the VT100 widget.
.RE
.IP
Programs running in an \fI\*n\fP can also use control sequences
to enable the VT100 reverse video mode.
These are independent of the \fIreverseVideo\fP resource and the menu entry.
\fI\*N\fP exchanges the current foreground and background colors
when drawing text affected by these control sequences.
.IP
Other control sequences can alter the foreground and background colors
which are used:
.RS
.bP
Programs can also use the ANSI color control sequences to set the
foreground and background colors.
.bP
Extensions to the ANSI color controls (such as 16-, 88- or 256-colors)
are treated similarly to the ANSI control.
.bP
Using other control sequences (the \*(``\fIdynamic colors\fR\*('' feature),
a program can change the foreground and background colors.

If \fI\*n\fP is started in a UTF-8 locale,
it translates the ISO-8859-1 string to UTF-8 to work with the X libraries
which assume the string is UTF-8.
.IP
However, some users may wish to write a title string encoded in UTF-8.
The window manager is responsible for drawing window titles.
Some window managers (not all) support UTF-8 encoding of window titles.
Set this resource to \*(``true\*('' to allow UTF-8 encoded title strings.
That cancels the translation to UTF-8,
allowing UTF-8 strings to be displayed as is.
.IP
This feature is available as a menu entry, since it is related to
the particular applications you are running within \fI\*n\fP.
You can also use a control sequence
(see the discussion of \*(``Title Modes\*(''
in the control sequences document), to set an equivalent flag.
The \fBtitleModes\fP resource sets the same value,
which overrides this resource.
.IP
The default is \*(``false\*(''.

Specifies whether to combine video attributes with colors specified by
\fBcolorBD\fR,

\fBcolorUL\fR.
The resource value is the sum of values for each attribute:

8 for blink, and
512 for italic
.fi
.RE
.IP
The default is \*(``0\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "visualBell (\fPclass\fB VisualBell)"
Specifies whether or not a visible bell (i.e., flashing) should be used instead
of an audible bell when Control-G is received.
The default is \*(``false\*('', which tells \fI\*n\fP to use an audible bell.
.TP 8
.B "visualBellDelay (\fPclass\fB VisualBellDelay)"
Number of milliseconds to delay when displaying a visual bell.
Default is 100.
If set to zero, no visual bell is displayed.
This is useful for very slow displays, e.g., an LCD display on a laptop.
.TP 8
.B "visualBellLine (\fPclass\fB VisualBellLine)"
Specifies whether to flash only the current line when displaying a visual bell
rather than flashing the entire screen:
The default is \*(``false\*('',
which tells \fI\*n\fP to flash the entire screen.
.TP 8
.B "vt100Graphics (\fPclass\fB VT100Graphics)"
This specifies whether \fI\*n\fP will interpret VT100 graphic character
escape sequences while in UTF-8 mode.
The default is \*(``true\*('', to provide support for various legacy applications.
.TP 8
.B "wideBoldFont (\fPclass\fB WideBoldFont)"
This option specifies the font to be used for displaying bold wide text.
By default,
it will attempt to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to
draw bold text.
If no double-width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching
the bold font.
.TP 8
.B "wideChars (\fPclass\fB WideChars)"
Specifies if \fI\*n\fP should respond to control sequences that
process 16-bit characters.
The default is \*(``false\*(''.
.TP 8
.B "wideFont (\fPclass\fB WideFont)"
This option specifies the font to be used for displaying wide text.
By default,
it will attempt to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to
draw normal text.
If no double-width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching
the normal font.
.TP 8
.B "ximFont (\fPclass\fB XimFont)"
This option specifies the font to be used for displaying the preedit string
in the \*(``OverTheSpot\*('' input method.
.IP
In \*(``OverTheSpot\*('' preedit type, the preedit (preconversion)
string is displayed at the position of the cursor.
It is the XIM server's responsibility to display the preedit string.
The XIM client must inform the XIM server of the cursor position.
For best results, the preedit string must be displayed with a proper font.
Therefore, \fI\*n\fP informs the XIM server of the proper font.
The font is be supplied by a "fontset", whose default value is \*(``*\*(''.
This matches every font, the X library automatically chooses fonts with
proper charsets.
The \fBximFont\fP resource is provided to override this default font setting.

.SH "POINTER USAGE"
.
.PP
Once the VT102 window is created,
.I \*n
allows you to select text and copy it within the same or other windows.
.
.SS "Selection"
.PP
The selection functions are invoked when the pointer buttons are used with no
modifiers, and when they are used with the \*(``shift\*('' key.
The assignment of the functions described below to keys and buttons may
be changed through the resource database; see \fBACTIONS\fP below.
.
.PP
Pointer button one (usually left) is used to save text into the cut buffer.
Move the cursor to beginning of the text,
and then hold the button down while moving the cursor to the end of the region
and releasing the button.
The selected text is highlighted and is saved in the global cut buffer
and made the PRIMARY selection when the button is released.
Normally (but see the discussion of \fBon2Clicks\fP, etc):
.bP
Double-clicking selects by words.
.bP
Triple-clicking
selects by lines.
.bP
Quadruple-clicking goes back to characters, etc.
.PP
Multiple-click is determined by the time from button up to
button down, so you can change the selection unit in the middle of a selection.
Logical words and lines selected by double- or triple-clicking may wrap
across more than one screen line if lines were wrapped by \fI\*n\fP
itself rather than by the application running in the window.
If the key/button bindings specify that an X selection is to be made,
\fI\*n\fP will leave the selected text highlighted for as long as it
is the selection owner.
.
.PP
Pointer button two (usually middle) \*(``types\*('' (pastes) the text from
the PRIMARY selection, if any, otherwise from
the cut buffer,
inserting it as keyboard input.
.
.PP
Pointer button three (usually right) extends the current selection.
(Without loss of generality,
you can swap \*(``right\*('' and \*(``left\*('' everywhere in the rest of this
paragraph.)  If pressed while closer to
the right edge of the selection than the left, it extends/contracts the
right edge of the selection.
If you contract the selection past
the left edge of the selection,
.I \*n
assumes you really meant the left edge, restores the original selection, then
extends/contracts the left edge of the selection.
Extension starts in the
selection unit mode
that the last selection or extension was performed in; you can multiple-click
to cycle through them.
.
.PP
By cutting and pasting pieces of text without trailing new lines,
you can take text from several places in different windows and form a command
to the shell, for example, or take output from a program and insert it into
your favorite editor.
Since cut buffers are globally shared among different applications,
you may regard each as a \*(``file\*('' whose contents you know.
The terminal emulator and other text programs should be treating it as if it
were a text file, i.e., the text is delimited by new lines.
.
.SS "Scrolling"
.PP
The scroll region displays the position and amount of text currently showing
in the window (highlighted) relative to the amount of text actually saved.
As more text is saved (up to the maximum), the size of the highlighted area
decreases.
.
.PP
Clicking button one with the pointer in the scroll region moves the
adjacent line to the top of the display window.
.
.PP
Clicking button three moves the top line of the display window down to the
pointer position.
.
.PP
Clicking button two moves the display to a position in the saved text
that corresponds to the pointer's position in the scrollbar.
.
.SS "Tektronix Pointer"
.PP
Unlike the VT102 window, the Tektronix window does not allow the copying of
text.
It does allow Tektronix GIN mode, and in this mode
the cursor will change from an arrow to a cross.
Pressing any key will send that key and the current coordinate of the
cross cursor.
Pressing button one, two, or three will return the letters \*(``l\*('', \*(``m\*('', and
\*(``r\*('', respectively.
If the \*(``shift\*('' key is pressed when a pointer button is pressed, the corresponding
upper case letter is sent.
To distinguish a pointer button from a key, the high bit of the character is
set (but this is bit is normally stripped unless the terminal mode is RAW;
see
.IR tty (4)
for details).
.
.
.SH SELECT/PASTE
X clients provide select and paste support by responding to requests conveyed
by the server.
.SS Primary
When configured to use the primary selection,
(the default) \fI\*n\fP can
provide the selection data in ways which help to retain character
encoding information as it is pasted.
.PP
A user \*(``selects\*('' text on \*n, which highlights the selected text.
A subsequent \*(``paste\*('' to another client forwards a request to the client owning
the selection.
If \fI\*n\fP owns the primary selection, it makes the data
available in the form of one or more \*(``selection targets\*(''.
If it does not own the primary selection,
e.g., if it has released it or another client has
asserted ownership, it relies on cut-buffers to pass the data.
But cut-buffers handle only ISO-8859-1 data
(officially \- some clients ignore the rules).
.
.SS Clipboard
When configured to use the clipboard (see resource \fBselectToClipboard\fP),
the problem with persistence of ownership is bypassed.
Otherwise, there is no difference regarding the data which can be
passed via selection.
.PP
The PRIMARY token is a standard X feature, documented in the ICCCM
(\fIInter-Client Communication Conventions Manual\fR),
which states
.RS
.PP
The selection named by the atom PRIMARY is used for all commands that take only a single argument and is the principal means of communication between clients that use the selection mechanism.
.RE
.PP
However, many applications use CLIPBOARD in imitation of other windowing
systems.
The \fBselectToClipboard\fP resource (and corresponding menu entry
\fISelect to Clipboard\fP) introduce the SELECT token (known only
to \fI\*n\fP) which chooses between the PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD tokens.
.PP
Without using this feature, one can use workarounds such as the
\fIxclip\fP program to show the contents of the X clipboard within an
\fI\*n\fP window.
.
.SS Selection Targets
The different types of data which are passed depend on what the receiving
client asks for.
These are termed \fIselection targets\fP.
.PP
When asking for the selection data,
\fI\*n\fP tries the following types in this order:
.RS
.TP 5
UTF8_STRING
This is an XFree86 extension, which denotes that the data is encoded in UTF-8.
When \fI\*n\fP is built with wide-character support,
it both accepts and provides this type.
.TP 5
TEXT
the text is in the encoding which corresponds to your current locale.
.TP 5
.\" see xc/doc/specs/CTEXT/ctext.tbl.ms
.\" (it says the data is stored as a type of ISO 2022)
COMPOUND_TEXT
this is a format for multiple character set data, such as multi-lingual text.
It can store UTF-8 data as a special case.
.TP 5
STRING
This is Latin 1 (ISO-8859-1) data.
.RE
.PP
The middle two (TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT) are added if \fI\*n\fP
is configured with the \fBi18nSelections\fP resource set to \*(``true\*(''.
.PP
UTF8_STRING is preferred (therefore first in the list)
since \fI\*n\fP stores text as Unicode data when
running in wide-character mode, and no translation is needed.
On the other hand, TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT may require translation.
If the translation is incomplete, they will insert X's \*(``defaultString\*(''
whose value cannot be set, and may simply be empty.
\fI\*N\fP's \fBdefaultString\fP resource specifies the string to
use for incomplete translations of the UTF8_STRING.
.PP
You can alter the types which \fI\*n\fP tries using the
\fBeightBitSelectTypes\fP or \fButf8SelectTypes\fP resources.
For instance, you might have some specific locale setting
which does not use UTF-8 encoding.
The resource value is a comma-separated list of the selection targets,
which consist of the names shown.
You can use the special name I18N
to denote the optional inclusion of TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT.
The names are matched ignoring case, and can be abbreviated.
The default list can be expressed in several ways, e.g.,
.sp
.RS
.nf
UTF8_STRING,I18N,STRING
utf8,i18n,string
u,i,s
.fi
.RE
.
.SH MENUS
.
.PP
\fI\*N\fP has four menus, named
.IR mainMenu ,
.IR vtMenu ,

when the \*(``control\*('' key and pointer button one are pressed in a window.
This menu contains items that apply to both the VT102 and Tektronix windows.
There are several sections:
.TP
Commands for managing X events:
.RS
.TP
Toolbar
Clicking on the \*(``Toolbar\*('' menu entry hides the toolbar if it is visible,
and shows it if it is not.
.TP
Secure Keyboard (securekbd)
The
.B Secure Keyboard
mode is helpful when typing in passwords or other sensitive data in an
unsecure environment;
see \fBSECURITY\fP below (but read the limitations carefully).
.TP
Allow SendEvents (allowsends)
Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button events generated using
the X protocol SendEvent request should be interpreted or discarded.
This corresponds to the \fBallowSendEvents\fP resource.
.TP
Redraw Window (redraw)
Forces the X display to repaint;
useful in some environments.
.RE
.TP
Commands for capturing output:
.RS
.TP
Log to File (logging)
Captures text sent to the screen in a logfile,
as in the \fB\-l\fP logging option.
.TP
Print-All Immediately
Invokes the \fBprint-immediate\fP action,
sending the text of the current window directly to a file,
as specified by the
\fBprintFileImmediate\fP,
\fBprintModeImmediate\fP and
\fBprintOptsImmediate\fP
resources.
.TP
Print-All on Error
Invokes the \fBprint-on-error\fP action,
which toggles a flag telling \fI\*n\fP that if it exits with an X error,
to send the text of the current window directly to a file,
as specified by the
\fBprintFileXError\fP,
\fBprintModeXError\fP and
\fBprintOptsXError\fP
resources.
.TP
Print Window (print)
Sends the text of the current window to the program given in the
\fBprinterCommand\fP resource.
.TP
Redirect to Printer (print-redir)
This sets the \fBprinterControlMode\fR to 0 or 2.
You can use this to turn the printer on as if an application had sent
the appropriate control sequence.
It is also useful for switching the printer
off if an application turns it on without resetting the print control mode.
.RE
.TP
Modes for setting keyboard style:
.RS
.TP
8-Bit Controls (8-bit-control)
Enabled for VT220 emulation, this controls whether \fI\*n\fP will send
8-bit control sequences rather than using 7-bit (ASCII) controls,
e.g., sending a byte in the range 128-159 rather than the escape character
followed by a second byte.
\fI\*N\fP always interprets both 8-bit and 7-bit control sequences
(see the document \fIXterm Control Sequences\fP).
This corresponds to the \fBeightBitControl\fP resource.
.TP
Backarrow Key (BS/DEL) (backarrow\ key)
Modifies the behavior of the backarrow key, making it transmit
either a backspace (8)
or delete (127) character.
This corresponds to the \fBbackarrowKey\fP resource.
.TP
Alt/NumLock Modifiers (num-lock)
Controls the treatment of Alt- and NumLock-key modifiers.
This corresponds to the \fBnumLock\fP resource.
.TP
Meta Sends Escape (meta-esc)
Controls whether \fIMeta\fP keys are converted into a two-character
sequence with the character itself preceded by ESC.
This corresponds to the \fBmetaSendsEscape\fP resource.
.TP
Delete is DEL (delete-is-del)
Controls whether the Delete key on the editing keypad should send DEL (127)
or the VT220-style Remove escape sequence.
This corresponds to the \fBdeleteIsDEL\fP resource.
.TP
Old Function-Keys (oldFunctionKeys)
.TP
HP Function-Keys (hpFunctionKeys)
.TP
SCO Function-Keys (scoFunctionKeys)
.TP
Sun Function-Keys (sunFunctionKeys)
.TP
VT220 Keyboard (sunKeyboard)
These act as a radio-button, selecting one style for the keyboard layout.
It corresponds to more than one resource setting:
.BR "sunKeyboard" ","
.BR "sunFunctionKeys" ","
.BR "scoFunctionKeys" " and"
.BR "hpFunctionKeys" "."
.RE

Commands for process signalling:
.RS
.TP
Send STOP Signal (suspend)
.TP
Send CONT Signal (continue)
.TP
Send INT Signal (interrupt)
.TP
Send HUP Signal (hangup)
.TP
Send TERM Signal (terminate)
.TP
Send KILL Signal (kill)
These send the SIGTSTP, SIGCONT, SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGTERM and SIGKILL
signals respectively, to the process group of the process running under
.I \*n
(usually the shell).
The
.B SIGCONT
function is especially useful if the user has accidentally typed CTRL-Z,
suspending the process.
.TP
Quit (quit)
Stop processing X events except to support the \fB-hold\fP option,
and then send a SIGHUP signal to the
process group of the process running under
.I \*n
(usually the shell).

.SH SECURITY
.
.PP
X environments differ in their security consciousness.
.bP
Most servers,
run under \fIxdm\fP,
are capable of using a \*(``magic cookie\*('' authorization
scheme that can provide a reasonable level of security for many people.
If your server is only using a host-based mechanism to control access to
the server (see \fIxhost(__mansuffix__)\fP), then if you enable access for a host and
other users are also permitted to run clients on that same host,
it is possible that someone can run an application which uses the
basic services of the X protocol to snoop on your activities,
potentially capturing a transcript of everything you type at the keyboard.
.bP
Any process which has access to your X display can manipulate it
in ways that you might not anticipate,
even redirecting your keyboard to itself
and sending events to your application's windows.
This is true even with the \*(``magic cookie\*('' authorization scheme.
While the \fBallowSendEvents\fP provides some protection against
rogue applications tampering with your programs,
guarding against a snooper is harder.
.
.bP
The X input extension for instance allows an application to bypass
all of the other (limited) authorization and security features,
including the GrabKeyboard protocol.
.
.bP
The possibility of an application spying on your keystrokes
is of particular concern when you want to type in a password
or other sensitive data.
The best solution to this problem is to use a better
authorization mechanism than is provided by X.
.PP
Subject to all of these caveats,
a simple mechanism exists for protecting keyboard input in \fI\*n\fP.
.
.PP
The \fI\*n\fP menu (see \fBMENUS\fP above) contains a \fBSecure Keyboard\fP
entry which, when enabled,
attempts to ensure that all keyboard input is directed
\fIonly\fP to \fI\*n\fP (using the GrabKeyboard protocol request).
When an application prompts you for a password
(or other sensitive data), you can enable \fBSecure Keyboard\fP using the
menu, type in the data, and then disable \fBSecure Keyboard\fP using
the menu again.
.bP
This ensures that you know which window is accepting your keystrokes.
.bP
It cannot ensure that there are no processes which have access to your
X display that might be observing the keystrokes as well.
.
.PP
Only one X client at a time can grab the keyboard,
so when you attempt to enable \fBSecure Keyboard\fP it may fail.
In this case, the bell will sound.
If the \fBSecure Keyboard\fP succeeds,
the foreground and background colors will be exchanged (as if you
selected the \fBReverse Video\fP entry in the \fBModes\fP menu);
they will be exchanged again when you exit secure mode.
If the colors
do \fInot\fP switch, then
you should be \fIvery\fP suspicious that you are being spoofed.
If the application you are running displays a prompt before asking for
the password, it is safest to enter secure mode \fIbefore\fP the
prompt gets displayed, and to make sure that the prompt gets displayed
correctly (in the new colors), to minimize the probability of
spoofing.
You can also bring up the menu again and make sure that a check
mark appears next to the entry.
.
.PP
\fBSecure Keyboard\fP mode will be disabled automatically if your \fI\*n\fP
window becomes iconified (or otherwise unmapped), or if you start up
a reparenting window manager (that places a title bar or other decoration
around the window) while in \fBSecure Keyboard\fP mode.
(This is a
feature of the X protocol not easily overcome.)  When this happens,
the foreground and background colors will be switched back and the bell
will sound in warning.
.
.
.SH "CHARACTER CLASSES"
Clicking the left pointer button twice in rapid succession
(double-clicking) causes all characters of the same class
(e.g., letters, white space, punctuation) to be selected as a \*(``word\*(''.
Since different people have different preferences for what should
be selected (for example, should filenames be selected as a whole or only
the separate subnames), the default mapping can be overridden through the use
of the \fBcharClass\fP (class \fICharClass\fP) resource.
.
.PP
This resource is a
series of comma-separated
\fIrange\fP:\fIvalue\fP pairs.
The
\fIrange\fP is either a single number or \fIlow\fP-\fIhigh\fP in the range of 0
to 65535, corresponding to the code for the character or characters to be
set.
The \fIvalue\fP is arbitrary, although the default table uses the
character number of the first character occurring in the set.
When not in
UTF-8 mode, only the first 256 bytes of this table will be used.
.
.PP
The default table starts as follows \-

For example, the string \*(``33:48,37:48,45\-47:48,38:48\*('' indicates that the
exclamation mark, percent sign, dash, period, slash, and ampersand characters
should be treated the same way as characters and numbers.
This is useful
for cutting and pasting electronic mailing addresses and filenames.

.SH KEY BINDINGS
.PP
It is possible to rebind keys (or sequences of keys) to arbitrary strings
for input, by changing the \fBtranslations\fP resources
for the vt100 or tek4014 widgets.
Changing the \fBtranslations\fP resource
for events other than key and button events is not expected,
and will cause unpredictable behavior.
.SS Actions
The following
actions are provided for use within the \fIvt100\fP or \fItek4014\fP
\fBtranslations\fP resources:
.TP 8
.B "allow-color-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowColorOps\fP resource and is also
invoked by the \fBallow-color-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow-font-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowFontOps\fP resource and is also
invoked by the \fBallow-font-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow-send-events(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowSendEvents\fP resource and is also
invoked by the \fBallowsends\fP entry in \fImainMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow-tcap-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowTcapOps\fP resource and is also
invoked by the \fBallow-tcap-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow-title-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowTitleOps\fP resource and is also
invoked by the \fBallow-title-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "allow-window-ops(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBallowWindowOps\fP resource and is also
invoked by the \fBallow-window-ops\fP entry in \fIfontMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "alt-sends-escape()"
This action toggles the state of the \fBaltSendsEscape\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "bell([\fIpercent\fP])"
This action rings the keyboard bell at the specified percentage
above or below the base volume.
.TP 8
.B "clear-saved-lines()"
This action does \fBhard-reset()\fP (see below) and also clears the history
of lines saved off the top of the screen.
It is also invoked from the \fBclearsavedlines\fP entry in \fIvtMenu\fP.
The effect is identical to a hardware reset (RIS) control sequence.
.TP 8
.B "copy-selection(\fIdestname\fP [, ...])"
This action puts the currently selected text into all of the selections or
cutbuffers specified by \fIdestname\fP.
Unlike \fBselect-end\fP, it does not send a mouse position or otherwise
modify the internal selection state.
.TP 8
.B "create-menu(\fIm/v/f/t\fP)"
This action creates one of the menus used by \fI\*n\fP,
if it has not been previously created.
The parameter values are the menu names:
\fImainMenu\fP, \fIvtMenu\fP, \fIfontMenu\fP, \fItekMenu\fP, respectively.
.TP 8
.B "dabbrev-expand()"
Expands the word before cursor by searching in the preceding text on the
screen and in the scrollback buffer for words starting with that
abbreviation.
Repeating \fBdabbrev-expand()\fP several times in sequence searches for an
alternative expansion by looking farther back.
Lack of more matches is signaled by a \fBbeep()\fP.
Attempts to expand an empty word
(i.e., when cursor is preceded by a space) yield successively all previous
words.
Consecutive identical expansions are ignored.
The word here is defined as a sequence of non-whitespace characters.
This feature partially emulates the behavior
of \*(``dynamic abbreviation\*('' expansion in Emacs (bound there to M\-/).
Here is a resource setting for \fI\*n\fP which will do the same thing:
.NS
*VT100*translations:    #override \\n\\\&
        Meta <KeyPress> /:dabbrev-expand()
.NE
.TP 8
.B "deiconify()"
Changes the window state back to normal, if it was iconified.
.TP 8
.B "delete-is-del()"
This action toggles the state of the \fBdeleteIsDEL\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "dired-button()"
Handles a button event (other than press and release)
by echoing the event's position
(i.e., character line and column) in the following format:
.sp
.in +8
^X ESC G <line+\*(`` \*(''> <col+\*(`` \*(''>
.in -8
.TP 8
.B "exec-formatted(\fIformat\fP, \fIsourcename\fP [, ...])"
Execute an external command,
using the current selection for part of the command's parameters.
The first parameter, \fIformat\fP gives the basic command.
Succeeding parameters specify the selection source as in \fBinsert-selection\fP.
.IP
The \fIformat\fP parameter allows these substitutions:
.RS
.TP 5
%%
inserts a "%".
.TP 5
%P
the screen-position at the beginning of the highlighted region,
as a semicolon-separated pair of integers using the
values that the CUP control sequence would use.
.TP 5
%p
the screen-position after the beginning of the highlighted region,
using the same convention as \*(``%P\*(''.
.TP 5
%S
the length of the string that \*(``%s\*('' would insert.
.TP 5
%s
the content of the selection, unmodified.
.TP 5
%T
the length of the string that \*(``%t\*('' would insert.
.TP 5
%t
the selection, trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace.
Embedded spaces (and newlines) are copied as is.
.TP 5
%R
the length of the string that \*(``%r\*('' would insert.
.TP 5
%r
the selection, trimmed of trailing whitespace.
.TP 5
%V
the video attributes at the beginning of the highlighted region,
as a semicolon-separated list of integers using the
values that the SGR control sequence would use.
.TP 5
%v
the video attributes after the end of the highlighted region,
using the same convention as \*(``%V\*(''.
.RE
.IP
After constructing the command-string,
\fI\*n\fP forks a subprocess and executes the command,
which completes independently of \fI\*n\fP.
.IP
For example, this translation would invoke a new \fI\*n\fP process
to view a file whose name is selected while holding the shift key down.
The new process is started when the mouse button is released:
.NS
*VT100*translations: #override Shift \\
    <Btn1Up>: exec-formatted("xterm -e view '%t'", SELECT)
.NE
.TP 8
.B "exec-selectable(\fIformat\fP, \fIonClicks\fP)"
Execute an external command,
using data copied from the screen for part of the command's parameters.
The first parameter, \fIformat\fP gives
the basic command as in \fBexec-formatted\fP.
The second parameter specifies the method for copying
the data as in the \fBonClicks\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "fullscreen(\fIon/off/toggle\fP)"
This action sets, unsets or toggles the \fBfullscreen\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "iconify()"
Iconifies the window.
.TP 8
.B "hard-reset()"
This action resets the scrolling region, tabs, window size, and cursor keys
and clears the screen.
It is also invoked from the \fBhardreset\fP
entry in \fIvtMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "ignore()"
This action ignores the event but checks for special pointer position
escape sequences.
.TP 8
.B "insert()"
This action inserts the character or string associated with
the key that was pressed.
.TP 8
.B "insert-eight-bit()"
This action inserts an eight-bit (Meta) version of the character or string
associated with the key that was pressed.
Only single-byte values are treated specially.
The exact action depends on the value of
the \fBaltSendsEscape\fP and
the \fBmetaSendsEscape\fP and
the \fBeightBitInput\fP resources.
The \fBmetaSendsEscape\fP resource is tested first.
See the \fBeightBitInput\fP resource for a full discussion.
.IP
The term \*(``eight-bit\*('' is misleading:
\fI\*n\fP checks if the key is in the range 128 to 255
(the eighth bit is set).
If the value is in that range,
depending on the resource values,
\fI\*n\fP may then do one of the following:
.RS
.bP
add 128 to the value, setting its eighth bit,
.bP
send an ESC byte before the key, or
.bP
send the key unaltered.
.RE
.TP 8
.B "insert-formatted(\fIformat\fP, \fIsourcename\fP [, ...])"
Insert the current selection or data related to it, formatted.
The first parameter, \fIformat\fP gives the template for the data
as in \fBexec-formatted\fP.
Succeeding parameters specify the selection source as in \fBinsert-selection\fP.
.TP 8
.B "insert-selectable(\fIformat\fP, \fIonClicks\fP)"
Insert data copied from the screen, formatted.
The first parameter, \fIformat\fP gives the template for the data
as in \fBexec-formatted\fP.
The second parameter specifies the method for copying
the data as in the \fBonClicks\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "insert-selection(\fIsourcename\fP [, ...])"
This action inserts the string found in the selection or cutbuffer indicated
by \fIsourcename\fP.
Sources are checked in the order given (case is
significant) until one is found.
Commonly-used selections include:
\fIPRIMARY\fP, \fISECONDARY\fP, and \fICLIPBOARD\fP.
Cut buffers are
typically named \fICUT_BUFFER0\fP through \fICUT_BUFFER7\fP.
.TP 8
.B "insert-seven-bit()"
This action is a synonym for \fBinsert()\fP.
The term \*(``seven-bit\*('' is misleading:
it only implies that \fI\*n\fP does not try to add 128 to the key's value
as in \fBinsert-eight-bit()\fP.
.TP 8
.B "interpret(\fIcontrol-sequence\fP)"
Interpret the given control sequence locally, i.e., without passing it to
the host.
This works by inserting the control sequence at the front
of the input buffer.
Use \*(``\\\*('' to escape octal digits in the string.
Xt does not allow you to put a null character (i.e., \*(``\\000\*('') in the string.
.TP 8
.B "keymap(\fIname\fP)"
This action dynamically defines a new translation table whose resource
name is \fIname\fP with the suffix \fIKeymap\fP (case is significant).
The name \fINone\fP restores the original translation table.
.TP 8
.B "larger-vt-font()"
Set the font to the next larger one, based on the font dimensions.
See also \fBset-vt-font()\fP.
.TP 8
.B "load-vt-fonts(\fIname\fP[,\fIclass\fP])"
Load fontnames from the given subresource name and class.
That is, load the \*(``*VT100.\fIname\fP.font\*('',
resource as \*(``*VT100.font\*('' etc.
If no name is given, the original set of fontnames is restored.
.IP
Unlike \fBset-vt-font()\fR, this does not affect the escape- and select-fonts,
since those are not based on resource values.
It does affect the fonts loosely organized under the \*(``Default\*('' menu
entry, including \fBfont\fP, \fBboldFont\fP, \fBwideFont\fP and \fBwideBoldFont\fP.
.TP 8
.B "maximize()"
Resizes the window to fill the screen.
.TP 8
.B "meta-sends-escape()"
This action toggles the state of the \fBmetaSendsEscape\fP resource.
.TP 8
.B "popup-menu(\fImenuname\fP)"
This action displays the specified popup menu.
Valid names (case is
significant) include:  \fImainMenu\fP, \fIvtMenu\fP, \fIfontMenu\fP,
and \fItekMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "print(\fIprinter-flags\fP)"
This action prints the window.
It is also invoked by the \fIprint\fP entry in \fImainMenu\fP.
.IP
The action accepts optional parameters, which temporarily override
resource settings.
The parameter values are matched ignoring case:
.RS
.TP 5
noFormFeed
no form feed will be sent at the end of the last line printed
(i.e., \fBprinterFormFeed\fP is ``false'').
.TP 5
FormFeed
a form feed will be sent at the end of the last line printed
(i.e., \fBprinterFormFeed\fP is ``true'').
.TP 5
noNewLine
no newline will be sent at the end of the last line printed,
and wrapped lines will be combined into long lines
(i.e., \fBprinterNewLine\fP is ``false'').
.TP 5
NewLine
a newline will be sent at the end of the last line printed,
and each line will be limited (by adding a newline) to the screen width
(i.e., \fBprinterNewLine\fP is ``true'').
.TP 5
noAttrs
the page is printed without attributes
(i.e., \fBprintAttributes\fP is ``0'').
.TP 5
monoAttrs
the page is printed with monochrome (vt220) attributes
(i.e., \fBprintAttributes\fP is ``1'').
.TP 5
colorAttrs
the page is printed with ANSI color attributes
(i.e., \fBprintAttributes\fP is ``2'').
.RE
.TP 8
.B "print-everything(\fIprinter-flags\fP)"
This action sends the entire text history, in addition to the text
currently visible, to the program given in the \fBprinterCommand\fP resource.
It allows the same optional parameters as the \fBprint\fP action.
With a suitable printer command, the action can be used to load the text
history in an editor.
.TP 8
.B "print-immediate()"
Sends the text of the current window directly to a file,
as specified by the
\fBprintFileImmediate\fP,
\fBprintModeImmediate\fP and
\fBprintOptsImmediate\fP
resources.
.TP 8

Toggles a flag telling \fI\*n\fP that if it exits with an X error,
to send the text of the current window directly to a file,
as specified by the
\fBprintFileXError\fP,
\fBprintModeXError\fP and
\fBprintOptsXError\fP
resources.
.TP 8
.B "print-redir()"
This action toggles the \fBprinterControlMode\fR between 0 and 2.
The corresponding popup menu entry is useful for switching the printer
off if you happen to change your mind after deciding to print random
binary files on the terminal.
.TP 8
.B "quit()"
This action sends a SIGHUP to the subprogram and exits.
It is also invoked
by the \fBquit\fP entry in \fImainMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "readline-button()"
Supports the optional readline feature by echoing repeated cursor forward
or backward control sequences on button release event,
to request that the host application update its notion of the cursor's
position to match the button event.
.TP 8
.B "redraw()"
This action redraws the window.
It is also invoked by the \fIredraw\fP entry in \fImainMenu\fP.
.TP 8
.B "restore()"
Restores the window to the size before it was last maximized.
.TP 8
.B "scroll-back(\fIcount\fP [,\fIunits\fP [,\fImouse\fP] ])"
This action scrolls the text window backward so that text that had previously
scrolled off the top of the screen is now visible.
.IP
The \fIcount\fP argument
indicates the number of \fIunits\fP (which may be \fIpage\fP, \fIhalfpage\fP,
\fIpixel\fP, or \fIline\fP) by which to scroll.
.IP
An adjustment can be specified for these values
by appending a \*(``+\*('' or \*(``\-\*(''
sign followed by a number,
e.g., \fIpage\-2\fP to specify 2 lines less than a page.
.IP
If the third parameter \fImouse\fP is given, the action is ignored when
mouse reporting is enabled.
.TP 8
.B "scroll-forw(\fIcount\fP [,\fIunits\fP [,\fImouse\fP] ])"
This action is similar to \fBscroll-back\fP except that it scrolls
in the other direction.
.TP 8
.B "secure()"

This action is similar to \fBselect-end\fP except that it should be used
with \fBselect-cursor-start\fP.
.TP 8
.B "select-cursor-extend()"
This action is similar to \fBselect-extend\fP except that it should be used
with \fBselect-cursor-start\fP.
.TP 8
.B "select-cursor-start()"

Here is an example which uses shifted select/paste to copy to the clipboard,

In each case, a (different) cut buffer is
also a target or source of the select/paste operation.
It is important to remember however,
that cut buffers store data in ISO-8859-1 encoding,
while selections can store data in a variety of formats and encodings.
While \fI\*n\fP owns the selection, it highlights it.
When it loses the selection, it removes the corresponding highlight.

In the example, the class name \fBVT100\fP is used rather than the widget name.
These are different;
the class name provides a more-specific match than the widget name.
A leading \*(``*\*('' is used because the widget hierarchy above the
\fBvt100\fP widget depends on
whether the toolbar support is compiled into \fI\*n\fP.

.SS Default Scrollbar Bindings
.PP
Key bindings are normally associated with the \fBvt100\fP or \fBtek4014\fP
widgets which act as terminal emulators.
\fI\*N\fP's scrollbar (and toolbar if it is configured) are separate widgets.
Because all of these use the X Toolkit,
they have corresponding \fBtranslations\fP resources.
Those resources are distinct,
and match different patterns, e.g., the differences in widget-name and
number of levels of widgets which they may contain.
.PP
The \fBscrollbar\fP widget is a child of the \fBvt100\fP widget.
It is positioned on top of the \fBvt100\fP widget.
Toggling the scrollbar on and off causes the \fBvt100\fP widget to resize.
.PP
The default bindings for the scrollbar widget use only mouse-button events:
.NS
                      <Btn5Down>: StartScroll(Forward) \\n\\\&
                      <Btn1Down>: StartScroll(Forward) \\n\\\&

                      <BtnUp>:    NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll()
.NE
.PP
Events which the \fBscrollbar\fP widget does not recognize at all are lost.
.PP
However, at startup, \fI\*n\fP augments these translations with the default
translations used for the \fBvt100\fP widget,
together with the resource \*(``actions\*('' which those translations use.
Because the \fBscrollbar\fP (or \fBmenubar\fP) widgets do not recognize these
actions (but because it has a corresponding \fBtranslation\fP),
they are passed on to the \fBvt100\fP widget.
.PP
This augmenting of the scrollbar's translations has a few limitations:
.bP
\fI\*N\fP knows what the default translations are,
but there is no suitable library interface for determining what
customizations a user may have added to the \fBvt100\fP widget.
All that \fI\*n\fP can do is augment the \fBscrollbar\fP widget to
give it the same starting point for further customization by the user.
.bP
Events in the gap between the widgets may be lost.
.bP
Compose sequences begun in one widget cannot be completed in the other,
because the input methods for each widget do not share context information.
.PP
Most customizations of the scrollbar translations do not concern key bindings.
Rather, users are generally more interested in changing the bindings of the
mouse buttons.
For example, some people prefer using the left pointer button
for dragging the scrollbar thumb.
That can be set up by altering the translations resource, e.g.,
.NS
*VT100.scrollbar.translations:  #override \\n\\\&
        <Btn5Down>:     StartScroll(Forward) \\n\\\&
        <Btn1Down>:     StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \\n\\\&

.SH "CONTROL SEQUENCES AND KEYBOARD"
Applications can send sequences of characters to the terminal to change its
behavior.
Often they are referred to as
\*(``ANSI escape sequences\*('' or just plain
\*(``escape sequences\*('' but both terms are misleading:
.bP
ANSI x3.64 (obsolete) which was replaced by ISO 6429 (ECMA-48) gave rules
for the \fIformat\fP of these sequences of characters.
.bP
While the original VT100 was claimed to be ANSI-compatible (against x3.64),
there is no freely available version of the ANSI standard to show where
the VT100 differs.
Most of the documents which mention the ANSI standard have
additions not found in the original (such as those
based on \fBansi.sys\fP).
So this discussion focuses on the ISO standards.
.bP
The standard describes only sequences sent from the host to the terminal.
There is no standard for sequences sent by special keys from the terminal
to the host.
By convention (and referring to existing terminals), the format of those
sequences usually conforms to the host-to-terminal standard.
.bP
Some of \fI\*n\fP's sequences do not fit into the standard scheme.
Technically those are \*(``unspecified\*(''.
As an example,
DEC Screen Alignment Test (DECALN) is this three-character sequence:
.NS
\fIESC\fP # 8
.NE
.PP
.bP
Some sequences fit into the standard format,
but are not listed in the standard.
These include the sequences used for setting up scrolling margins
and doing forward/reverse scrolling.
.bP
Some of the sequences (in particular, the single-character functions
such as tab and backspace)
do not include the \fIescape\fP character.
.PP
With all of that in mind, the standard refers to these sequences of
characters as \*(``control sequences\*(''.
.PP
The \fI\*N Control Sequences\fP document lists the control sequences which
an application can send \fI\*n\fP to make it perform various operations.
Most of these operations are standardized, from either the DEC or Tektronix
terminals, or from more widely used standards such as ISO-6429.
.PP
A few examples of usage are given in this section.
.SS Window Titles
.PP
Some scripts use \fBecho\fP with options \fB\-e\fP and \fB\-n\fP to tell
the shell to interpret the string \*(``\\e\*('' as the \fIescape\fP character and
to suppress a trailing newline on output.
Those are not portable, not recommended.
Instead, use \fBprintf\fP (POSIX).
.PP
For example, to set the \fIwindow title\fP to \*(``Hello world!\*('',
you could use one of these commands in a script:
.NS
printf '\\033]2;Hello world!\\033\\'
printf '\\033]2;Hello world!\\007'
printf '\\033]2;%s\\033\\' "Hello world!"
printf '\\033]2;%s\\007' "Hello world!"
.NE
.PP
The \fBprintf\fP command interprets the octal value \*(``\\033\*('' for
\fIescape\fP, and (since it was not given in the format) omits a trailing
newline from the output.
.PP
Some programs (such as \fBscreen\fP(1)) set both window- and icon-titles
at the same time, using a slightly different control sequence.
.
.SS Special Keys
.PP
\fI\*N\fP, like any VT100-compatible terminal emulator,
has two modes for the \fIspecial keys\fP (cursor-keys, numeric keypad,
and certain function-keys):
.bP
\fInormal mode\fP, which makes the special keys transmit 
\*(``useful\*('' sequences such as the control sequence for cursor-up
when pressing the up-arrow, and
.bP
\fIapplication mode\fP,
which uses a different control sequence that cannot be mistaken for
the 
\*(``useful\*('' sequences.
.PP
The main difference between the two modes is that normal mode sequences
start with \fICSI\fP (\fIescape\ [\fP) and application mode sequences
start with \fISS3\fP (\fIescape\ O\fP).
.PP
The terminal is initialized into one of these two modes (usually the
normal mode), based on the terminal description (termcap or terminfo).
The terminal description also has capabilities (strings) defined for
the keypad mode used in curses applications.
.PP
There is a problem in using the terminal description for applications
that are not intended to be full-screen curses applications:
the definitions of special keys are only correct for this keypad mode.
For example, some shells
(unlike \fBksh\fP(1), which appears to be hard-coded, not even using termcap)
allow their users to customize key-bindings,
assigning shell actions to special keys.
.bP
\fBbash\fP(1) allows \fIconstant\fP strings to be assigned
to functions.
This is only successful if the terminal is initialized to application
mode by default,
because \fBbash\fP lacks flexibility in this area.
It uses a (less expressive than \fBbash\fP's)
\fBreadline\fP scripting language for setting up key bindings,
which relies upon the user to statically enumerate the possible bindings for
given values of $TERM.
.bP
\fBzsh\fP(1) provides an analogous feature,
but it accepts runtime expressions,
as well as providing a \fB$terminfo\fP array for scripts.
In particular, one can use the terminal database,
transforming when defining a key-binding.
By transforming the output so that \fICSI\fP and \fISS3\fP are equated,
\fBzsh\fP can use the terminal database to obtain useful definitions
for its command-line use regardless of whether the terminal uses
normal or application mode initially.
Here is an example:
.NS
[[ "$terminfo[kcuu1]" == "^[O"* ]] && \\
bindkey -M viins "${terminfo[kcuu1]/O/[}" \\
vi-up-line-or-history
.NE
.
.
.SS Changing Colors
.PP
A few shell programs provide the ability for users to add color and other
video attributes to the shell prompt strings.
Users can do this by setting $PS1 (the primary prompt string).
Again, \fBbash\fP and \fBzsh\fP have provided features not found in \fBksh\fP.
There is a problem, however: the prompt's width on the screen will not
necessarily be the same as the number of characters.
Because there is no guidance in the POSIX standard, each shell addresses
the problem in a different way:
.bP
\fBbash\fP treats characters within 
\*(``\\[\*('' and
\*(``\\]\*(''
as nonprinting (using no width on the screen).
.bP
\fBzsh\fP treats characters within 
\*(``%{\*('' and
\*(``%}\*(''
as nonprinting.
.PP
In addition to the difference in syntax,
the shells provide different methods for obtaining useful escape sequences:
.bP
As noted in \fISpecial Keys\fP, \fBzsh\fP initializes the $terminfo array
with the terminal capabilities.
.IP
It also provides a function \fBechoti\fP which works like \fBtput\fP(1)
to convert a terminal capability with its parameters into a string
that can be written to the terminal.
.bP
Shells lacking a comparable feature (such as \fBbash\fP) can always
use the program \fBtput\fP to do this transformation.
.PP
Hard-coded escape sequences are supported by each shell,
but are not recommended because those rely upon particular configurations
and cannot be easily moved between different user environments.
.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
\fI\*N\fP sets several environment variables:
.TP 5
DISPLAY
is the display name,
pointing to the X server (see \fBDISPLAY NAMES\fP in X(__miscmansuffix__)).
.TP 5
TERM
is set according to the terminfo (or termcap) entry which it is using as
a reference.
.IP
On some systems, you may encounter situations where the shell which you
use and \fI\*n\fP are built using libraries with different terminal databases.
In that situation, \fI\*n\fP may choose a terminal description not known
to the shell.
.TP 5
WINDOWID
is set to the X window id number of the \fI\*n\fP window.
.TP 5
XTERM_FILTER
is set if a locale-filter is used.
The value is the pathname of the filter.
.TP 5
XTERM_LOCALE
shows the locale which was used by \fI\*n\fP on startup.
Some shell initialization scripts may set a different locale.
.TP 5
XTERM_SHELL
is set to the pathname of the program which is invoked.
Usually that is a shell program, e.g., \fI/bin/sh\fP.
Since it is not necessarily a shell program however,
it is distinct from \*(``SHELL\*(''.
.TP 5
XTERM_VERSION
is set to the string displayed by the \fB\-version\fP option.
That is normally an identifier for the X Window libraries used to
build \fI\*n\fP, followed by
\fI\*n\fP's patch number in parenthesis.
The patch number is also part of the response to a Secondary Device Attributes
(DA) control sequence (see \fIXterm Control Sequences\fP).
.
.PP
Depending on your system configuration, \fI\*n\fP may also set the
following:
.TP 5
COLUMNS
the width of the \fI\*n\fP in characters (cf: \*(``stty columns\*('').
.TP 5
HOME
when \fI\*n\fP is configured to update utmp.
.TP 5
LINES
the height of the \fI\*n\fP in characters (cf: \*(``stty rows\*('').
.TP 5
LOGNAME
when \fI\*n\fP is configured to update utmp.
.TP 5
SHELL
when \fI\*n\fP is configured to update utmp.
It is also set if you provide a valid shell name as the optional parameter.
.IP
\fI\*N\fP sets this to an absolute pathname.
If you have set the variable to a relative pathname,
\fI\*n\fP may set it to a different shell pathname.
.IP
If you have set this to an pathname which does not correspond to a valid
shell, \fI\*n\fP may unset it, to avoid confusion.
.TP 5
TERMCAP
the contents of the termcap entry corresponding to $TERM,
with lines and columns values substituted
for the actual size window you have created.
.TP 5
TERMINFO
may be defined to a nonstandard location in the configure script.
.\"
.
.
.SH FILES
The actual pathnames given may differ on your system.
.TP 5
\fI/etc/shells\fP
contains a list of valid shell programs,
used by \fI\*n\fP to decide if the \*(``SHELL\*('' environment
variable should be set for the process started by \fI\*n\fP.
.TP 5
\fI/etc/utmp\fP
the system logfile, which records user logins.
.TP 5
\fI/etc/wtmp\fP
the system logfile, which records user logins and logouts.
.TP 5
.I __apploaddir__/__default_class__
the \fI\*n\fP default application resources.
.TP 5
.I __apploaddir__/__default_class__\-color
the \fI\*n\fP color application resources.
If your display supports color, use this
.in +10
*customization: \-color
.in -10
in your .Xdefaults file to
automatically use this resource file rather than
.IR __apploaddir__/__default_class__ .
If you do not do this,
\fI\*n\fP uses its compiled-in default resource settings for colors.
.TP 5
.I __pixmapsdir__
the directory in which \fI\*n\fP's pixmap icon files are installed.
.
.
.SH ERROR MESSAGES
Most of the fatal error messages from \fI\*n\fP use the following format:
.RS
\*n: Error \fIXXX\fP, errno \fIYYY\fP: \fIZZZ\fP
.RE
The \fIXXX\fP codes (which are used by \fI\*n\fP as its exit-code)
are listed below, with a brief explanation.

.SH BUGS
.
.PP
Large pastes do not work on some systems.
This is not a bug in
\fI\*n\fP; it is a bug in the pseudo terminal driver of those
systems.
\fI\*N\fP feeds large pastes to the pty only as fast as the pty
will accept data, but some pty drivers do not return enough information
to know if the write has succeeded.
.
.PP
When connected to an input method, it is possible for \*n to hang
if the XIM server is suspended or killed.
.
.PP
Many of the options are not resettable after
.I \*n
starts.
.
.PP
This program still needs to be rewritten.
It should be split into very
modular sections, with the various emulators being completely separate
widgets that do not know about each other.
Ideally, you'd like to be able to
pick and choose emulator widgets and stick them into a single control widget.
.
.PP
There needs to be a dialog box to allow entry of the Tek COPY file name.
