	This file contains routines for manipulating generic lists.
	Lists are implemented with a "harness".  In other words, each
	node in the list consists of two pointers, one to the data item
	and one to the next node in the list.  The head of the list is
	the same struct as each node, but the "item" ptr is used to point
	to the current member of the list (used by the first_in_list and
	next_in_list functions).
