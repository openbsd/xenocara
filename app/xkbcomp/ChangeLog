    xkbcomp: Improved -w option parsing
    
    This patch improves -w option parsing even further, for cases like
    "xkbcomp -w6 4.xkb out.xkb" (which were not handled by the fix of
    the warning level is still optional (set to 0 if not present), and

    Interp: Allow explicit Any/NoSymbol mappings
    
    Brown paper bag in full effect.
    
    The previous fix, while crushing the previous problem where an unknown
    keysym for an interp def would lead to every key matching it, also
    ignored explicit Any+AnyOfOrNone(All) mappings.
    
    Such as the one xkeyboard-config relied on for Control to actually
    update the modifier state.
    
    Fix this by allowing mappings explicitly declared as Any/NoSymbol, while
    ignoring only those with failed keysym lookups.  Unfortunately, due to
    the structure of the parser, it's a deeply inelegant fix.
    
    Verified with a quick check of all layouts (albeit using default
    variants only) in xkeyboard-config that this results in no changes to
    the output at all, compared to xkbcomp 1.1.1.

    Interp: Ignore NoSymbol definitions
    
    A NoSymbol syminterp leads to a Any+AnyOfOrAll(None) definition, which
    is never what anyone would actually ever want in a sym interp.  The
    failure mode here was:
        interpret XF86SomeKeysymYouDontHaveYet {
            action=Something()
        }
    leading to:
        interpret Any+AnyOfOrAll(None) {
            action=Something()
        }
    leading to every single non-action key triggering your shiny new action
    that was only supposed to come from a new keysym.
    
    At least you could VT switch or zap, I guess.
    
    Later, more invasive, revisions will bring a more useful error message.

    Use temporary buffer for generating Uxxx names to avoid overflow
    
    Instead of sprintf()'ing a 4 character string to a char [4] buffer,
    and leaving the trailing '\0' to overwrite into the next entry,
    snprintf() to a 5 character temp buffer and memcpy the 4 characters
    to the right place.
    
    Fixes parfait errors:

    Allow the default XKB config root to be set from configure
    
    The default was hardcoded in the Makefile as $(datadir)/share/X11/xkb.
    This could cause a problem if you are installing xkbcomp to an alternate
    location but want to continue using the system's XKB data.

    Correct make distcheck and most gcc and sparse warnings.
    
      Remaining warnings are due to macros that check address or vectors
    on the stack and auto generated yacc code.
    
      Compiled with default flags and also as:
    % make CFLAGS=-DENTRY_TRACKING_ON -DDEBUG_ON -DASSERTIONS_ON
      to ensure the "simplification" of code like:
    foo.c:
    <hash>define DEBUG_VAR foo_VAR
    <hash>include "foo.h"
    ...
    foo.h:
    <hash>ifdef DEBUG_VAR_NOT_LOCAL
    extern
    <hash>endif
    int DEBUG_VAR;
    ...
    did not change the author's "intended" logic.

    Don't overwrite previously assigned type indices with useless ones.
    
    The default type for a key with no levels is ONE_LEVEL.
    Let's not overwrite the kt_index with this default type if we have previously
    assigned a real type.
    
    Reproduceable by running setxkbmap -layout "ru(phonetic),us", the first group
    is assigned ONE_LEVEL and shift stops working.
