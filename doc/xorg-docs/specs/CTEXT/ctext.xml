<title>Overview</title>

<para>
Compound Text is a format for multiple character set data, such as
multi-lingual text.  The format is based on ISO
standards for encoding and combining character sets.  Compound Text is intended
to be used in three main contexts: inter-client communication using selections,
as defined in the
<emphasis remap='I'>Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual</emphasis>
(ICCCM); <!-- xref -->
window properties (e.g., window manager hints as defined in the ICCCM);
and resources (e.g., as defined in Xlib and the Xt Intrinsics).
</para>

<para>
Compound Text is intended as an external representation, or interchange format,
not as an internal representation.  It is expected (but not required) that
clients will convert Compound Text to some internal representation for
processing and rendering, and convert from that internal representation to
Compound Text when providing textual data to another client.
</para>

<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The name of this encoding is "COMPOUND_TEXT".  When text values are used in
the ICCCM-compliant selection mechanism or are stored as window properties in
the server, the type used should be the atom for "COMPOUND_TEXT".
</para>

<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Octet values are represented in this document as two decimal numbers in the
form col/row.  This means the value (col * 16) + row.  For example, 02/01 means
the value 33.
</para>
<para>
For our purposes, the octet encoding space is divided into four ranges:

<para>
<!-- .LP -->
C0 and C1 are "control character" sets, while GL and GR are "graphic
character" sets.  Only a subset of C0 and C1 octets are used in the encoding,
and depending on the character set encoding defined as GL or GR, a subset of
GL and GR octets may be used; see below for details.  All octets (00/00 to
15/15) may appear inside the text of extended segments (defined below).

[Note that 00/10 is normally LINEFEED, but is being interpreted as NEWLINE.
This can be thought of as using the (deprecated) NEW LINE mode, E.1.3, in ISO

with the STRING type currently defined in the ICCCM.]

The "F"in the control sequences above stands for "Final character", which
is always in the range 04/00 to 07/14.  The "{I}" stands for zero or more
"intermediate characters", which are always in the range 02/00 to 02/15, with
the first intermediate character always in the range 02/01 to 02/03.  The
registration authority has defined an "{I} F" sequence for each registered
character set encoding.

Once a GL or GR set has been defined, all further octets in that range (except
within control sequences and extended segments) are interpreted with respect to
that character set encoding, until the GL or GR set is redefined.  GL and GR
sets can be defined independently, they do not have to be defined in pairs.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Note that when actually using a character set encoding as the GR set, you must
force the most significant bit (08/00) of each octet to be a one, so that it
falls in the range 10/00 to 15/15.

[Control sequences to specify character set encoding revisions (as in section
6.3.13 of ISO 2022) are not used in Compound Text.  Revision indicators do not
appear to provide useful information in the context of Compound Text.  The most

<!-- .LP -->
The "M" and "L" octets represent a 14-bit unsigned value giving the number
of octets that appear in the remainder of the segment.  The number is computed
as ((M - 128) * 128) + (L - 128).  The most significant bit M and L are always
set to one.  The remainder of the segment consists of two parts, the name of
the character set encoding and the actual text.  The name of the encoding comes
first and is separated from the text by the octet 00/02 (STX, START OF TEXT).
Note that the length defined by M and L includes the encoding name and
separator.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
[The encoding of the length is chosen to avoid having zero octets in Compound
Text when possible, because embedded NUL values are problematic in many C
language routines.  The use of zero octets cannot be ruled out entirely
however, since some octets in the actual text of the extended segment may have
to be zero.]
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The name of the encoding should be registered with the X Consortium to avoid
conflicts and should when appropriate match the CharSet Registry and Encoding
registration used in the X Logical Font Description.  The name itself should be
encoded using ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1), should not use question mark (03/15) or
asterisk (02/10), and should use hyphen (02/13) only in accordance with the X
Logical Font Description.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Extended segments are not to be used for any character set encoding that can
be constructed from a GL/GR pair of approved standard encodings. For
example, it is incorrect to use an extended segment for any of the ISO 8859
family of encodings.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
It should be noted that the contents of an extended segment are arbitrary;
for example,
they may contain octets in the C0 and C1 ranges, including 00/00, and
octets comprising a given character may differ in their most significant bit.

<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Directionality can be nested.  Logically, a stack of directions is maintained.
Each of the first two control sequences pushes a new direction on the stack,
and the third sequence (revert) pops a direction from the stack.  The stack
starts out empty at the beginning of a Compound Text string.  When the stack is
empty, the directionality of the text is unspecified.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Directionality applies to all subsequent text, whether in GL, GR, or an
extended segment.  If the desired directionality of GL, GR, or extended
segments differs, then directionality control sequences must be inserted when

Note that definition of GL and GR sets is independent of directionality;
defining a new GL or GR set does not change the current directionality, and
pushing or popping a directionality does not change the current GL and GR
definitions.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Specification of directionality is entirely optional; text direction should be
clear from context in most cases.  However, it must be the case that either
all characters in a Compound Text string have explicitly specified direction
or that all characters have unspecified direction.  That is, if directionality
control sequences are used, the first such control sequence must precede the
first graphic character in a Compound Text string, and graphic characters are
not permitted whenever the directionality stack is empty.

To use Compound Text in a resource, you can simply treat all octets as if they
were ASCII/Latin-1 and just replace all "\" octets (05/12) with the two
octets "\\", all newline octets (00/10) with the two octets "\n", and
all zero octets with the four octets "\000".
It is up to the client making use of the resource to interpret the data as
Compound Text; the policy by which this is ascertained is not constrained by
the Compound Text specification.

<!-- .LP -->
There is no absolute requirement for a parser to deal with anything but the
particular encoding syntax defined in this specification.  However, it is
possible that Compound Text may be extended in the future, and as such it may
be desirable to construct the parser to handle 2022/6429 syntax more generally.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
There are two general formats covering all control sequences that are expected
to appear in extensions:
</para>

<para>
01/11 {I} F
</para>

<para>
For this format, I is always in the range 02/00 to 02/15, and F is always
in the range 03/00 to 07/14.
</para>

<para>
09/11 {P} {I} F
</para>

<para>
For this format, P is always in the range 03/00 to 03/15, I is always in
the range 02/00 to 02/15, and F is always in the range 04/00 to 07/14.
</para>

<para>
<!-- .LP -->
In addition, new (singleton) control characters (in the C0 and C1 ranges) might
be defined in the future.
</para>

<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Finally, new kinds of "segments" might be defined in the future using syntax
similar to extended segments:
</para>

<para>
01/11 02/05 02/15 F M L
</para>

<para>
For this format, F is in the range 03/05 to 3/15.  M and L are as defined
in extended segments.  Such a segment will always be followed by the number
of octets defined by M and L.  These octets can have arbitrary values and
need not follow the internal structure defined for current extended
segments.
</para>

<para>
<!-- .LP -->
If extensions to this specification are defined in the future, then any string
incorporating instances of such extensions must start with one of the following
control sequences:
</para>

<informaltable frame="none">

<para>
<!-- .LP -->
In either case, V is in the range 02/00 to 02/15 and indicates the major
version
minus one of the specification being used.  These version control sequences are
for use by clients that implement earlier versions, but have implemented a
general parser.  The first control sequence indicates that it is acceptable to
ignore all extension control sequences; no mandatory information will be lost
in the process.  The second control sequence indicates that it is unacceptable
to ignore any extension control sequences; mandatory information would be lost
in the process.  In general, it will be up to the client generating the
Compound Text to decide which control sequence to use.

<para>
<!-- .LP -->
If a Compound Text string does not match the specification here (e.g., uses
undefined control characters, or undefined control sequences, or incorrectly
formatted extended segments), it is best to treat the entire string as invalid,
except as indicated by a version control sequence.
