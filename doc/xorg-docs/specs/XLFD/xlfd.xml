<title>Introduction</title>
<!-- .XS -->
<!-- (SN Introduction -->
<!-- .XE -->
<para>
It is a requirement that X client applications must be portable across server
implementations, with very different file systems, naming conventions, and
font libraries.
However, font access requests,
as defined by the <emphasis remap='I'>X Window System Protocol</emphasis>,
neither specify server-independent conventions for font names
nor provide adequate font properties for logically describing typographic fonts.
</para>
<para>
X clients must be able to dynamically determine the fonts available
on any given server so that understandable information can be presented
to the user or so that intelligent font fallbacks can be chosen.
It is desirable for the most common queries to be accomplished
without the overhead of opening each font and inspecting font properties,
by means of simple
<function>ListFonts</function>
requests.
For example, if a user selected a Helvetica typeface family,
a client application should be able to query the server
for all Helvetica fonts and present only those setwidths, weights, slants,
point sizes, and character sets available for that family.
</para>
<para>
This document gives a standard logical font description
(hereafter referred to as XLFD) and the conventions to be used
in the core protocol so that clients can query and access screen type libraries
in a consistent manner across all X servers.
In addition to completely specifying a given font by means of its
<function>FontName</function>,
the XLFD also provides for a standard set of key
<function>FontProperties</function>
that describe the font in more detail.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The XLFD provides an adequate set of typographic font properties,
such as CAP_HEIGHT, X_HEIGHT,
and RELATIVE_SETWIDTH,
for publishing and other applications to do intelligent font matching
or substitution when handling documents created on some foreign server
that use potentially unknown fonts.
In addition,
this information is required by certain clients
to position subscripts automatically and determine small capital heights,
recommended leading, word-space values, and so on.

<title>Provide Unique and Descriptive Font Names</title>
<!-- .XS -->
<!-- (SN Provide Unique and Descriptive Font Names -->
<!-- .XE -->
<para>
It should be possible to have font names that are long enough and
descriptive enough to have a reasonable probability of being unique
without inventing a new registration organization.
Resolution and size-dependent font masters, multivendor font libraries,
and so on must be anticipated and handled by the font name alone.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The name itself should be structured to be amenable to simple pattern
matching and parsing, thus allowing X clients to restrict font queries to
some subset of all possible fonts in the server.
</para>

<title>Support Multiple Font Vendors and Character Sets</title>
<!-- .XS -->
<!-- (SN Support Multiple Font Vendors and Character Sets -->
<!-- .XE -->
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The font name and properties should distinguish between fonts
that were supplied by different font vendors
but that possibly share the same name.
We anticipate a highly competitive font market where users will be able to
buy fonts from many sources according to their particular requirements.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
A number of font vendors deliver each font with all glyphs designed for that
font, where charset mappings are defined by encoding vectors.
Some server implementations may force these mappings to proprietary
or standard charsets statically in the font data.
Others may desire to perform the mapping dynamically in the server.
Provisions must be made in the font name
that allows a font request to specify or identify specific charset mappings
in server environments where multiple charsets are supported.
</para>

<title>Support Scalable and Polymorphic Fonts</title>
<!-- .XS -->
<!-- (SN Support Scalable and Polymorphic Fonts -->
<!-- .XE -->
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
If a font source can be scaled to an arbitrary size or varied in other
ways, it should be possible for an application to determine
that fact from the font name, and the
application should be able to construct a font name for any specific
instance.
</para>

<title>Support Transformations and Subsetting of Fonts</title>
<!-- .XS -->
<!-- (SN Support Transformations and Subsetting of Fonts -->
<!-- .XE -->
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Arbitrary two-dimensional linear transformations of fonts should be
able to be requested by applications.  Since such transformed fonts
may be used for special effects requiring a few characters from each
of many differently transformed fonts, it should be possible to
request only a few characters from a font for efficiency.
</para>

<title>Be Independent of X Server and Operating or File System Implementations</title>
<!-- .XS -->
<!-- (SN Be Independent of X Server and Operating or File System Implementations -->
<!-- .XE -->
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
X client applications that require a particular font should be able to use
the descriptive name without knowledge of the file system or other
repository in use by the server.
However,
it should be possible for servers to translate a given font name
into a file name syntax that it knows how to deal with,
without compromising the uniqueness of the font name.
This algorithm should be reversible (exactly how this translation is done is
implementation dependent).

<!-- .XS -->
<!-- (SN Support Arbitrarily Complex Font Matching and Substitution -->
<!-- .XE -->
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
In addition to the font name,
the XLFD should define a standard list of descriptive font properties,
with agreed-upon fallbacks for all fonts.
This allows client applications to derive font-specific formatting
or display data and to perform font matching or substitution
when asked to handle potentially unknown fonts, as required.

XLFD is divided into two basic components:
the
<function>FontName</function>,
which gives all font information needed to uniquely identify a font
in X protocol requests (for example,
<function>OpenFont</function>,
<function>ListFonts</function>,
and so on) and a variable list of optional
<function>FontProperties</function>,
which describe a font in more detail.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The
<function>FontName</function>
is used in font queries and is returned as data in certain X protocol requests.
It is also specified as the data value for the
<function>FONT</function>
item in the X Consortium Character Bitmap Distribution Format Standard
(BDF V2.1).
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The
<function>FontProperties</function>
are supplied on a font-by-font basis and are returned
as data in certain X protocol requests as part of the
<function>XFontStruct</function>
data structure.
The names and associated data values for each of the
<function>FontProperties</function>
may also appear as items of the
<function>STARTPROPERTIES</function>...<function>ENDPROPERTIES</function>list
in the BDF V2.1 specification. <!-- xref -->

<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Each
<function>FontName</function>
is logically composed of two strings: a
<function>FontNameRegistry</function>
prefix that is followed by a
<function>FontNameSuffix</function>.
The
<function>FontName</function>
uses the ISO 8859-1 encoding.
The
<function>FontNameRegistry</function>
is an
<!-- .IN x-registered-name -->
x-registered-name (a name that has been registered with the X Consortium)
that identifies the registration authority that owns the specified
<function>FontNameSuffix</function>
syntax and semantics.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
All font names that conform to this specification are to use a
<function>FontNameRegistry</function>
prefix, which is defined to be the string "-"
(HYPHEN).
All
<function>FontNameRegistry</function>
prefixes of the form: +<emphasis remap='I'>version</emphasis>-,
where the specified version indicates some future XLFD specification,
are reserved by the X Consortium for future extensions to XLFD font names.
If required, extensions to the current XLFD font name shall be constructed
by appending new fields to the current structure,
each delimited by the existing field delimiter.
The availability of other
<function>FontNameRegistry</function>
prefixes or fonts that support other registries
is server implementation dependent.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
In the X protocol specification,
the
<function>FontName</function>
is required to be a string;
hence, numeric field values are represented in the name as string equivalents.
All
<function>FontNameSuffix</function>
fields are also defined as
<function>FontProperties</function>;
numeric property values are represented as signed or unsigned integers,
as appropriate.

Alphabetic case distinctions are allowed but are for human readability
concerns only.
Conforming X servers will perform matching on font name query or open requests
independent of case.
The entire font name string must have no more than 255 characters.
It is recommended that clients construct font name query patterns
by explicitly including all field delimiters to avoid unexpected results.
Note that SPACE is a valid character of a

field; for example, the string "ITC Avant Garde Gothic" might be a
FAMILY_NAME.

<!-- .LP -->
The reason this distinction is necessary is
that a given font design may be licensed from one source (for example, ITC)
but digitized and sold by any number of different type suppliers.
Each digital version of the original design, in general, will be somewhat
different in metrics and shape from the idealized original font data,
because each font foundry, for better or for worse, has its own standards
and practices for tweaking a typeface for a particular generation
of output technologies or has its own perception of market needs.

WEIGHT_NAME is a string that identifies the font's typographic weight,
that is, the nominal blackness of the font,
according to the FOUNDRY's judgment.
This name must be human-understandable and suitable for presentation to a
font user.
The value "0" is used to indicate a polymorphic font (see <xref linkend="polymorphic_fonts"/>).
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The interpretation of this field is somewhat problematic
because the typographic judgment of weight has traditionally
depended on the overall design of the typeface family in question;
that is, it is possible that the DemiBold weight of one font could be
almost equivalent in typographic feel to a Bold font from another family.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
WEIGHT_NAME is captured as an arbitrary string
because it is an important part of a font's complete human-understandable name.
However, it should not be used for font matching or substitution.
For this purpose,
X client applications should use the weight-related font properties
(RELATIVE_WEIGHT and WEIGHT) that give the coded relative weight

SETWIDTH_NAME is a string that gives the font's typographic

The value "0" is used to indicate a polymorphic font (see <xref linkend="polymorphic_fonts"/>).

As with WEIGHT_NAME, the interpretation of this field or font property is

PIXEL_SIZE
gives the body size of the font at a particular

PIXEL_SIZE is either an integer-string or a string beginning

(see <xref linkend="matrix_transformations"/>).
PIXEL_SIZE usually incorporates additional vertical spacing
that is considered part of the font design.

This field usually incorporates additional vertical spacing

<para>
<!-- .LP  -->
RESOLUTION_X and RESOLUTION_Y are unsigned integer-strings that give
the horizontal and vertical resolution,
measured in pixels or dots per inch (dpi),
for which the font was designed.
Zero is used to indicate a scalable font (see <xref linkend="scalable_fonts"/>).
Horizontal and vertical values are required
because a separate bitmap font must be designed
for displays with very different aspect ratios
(for example, 1:1, 4:3, 2:1, and so on).
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP  -->
The separation of pixel or point size and resolution is necessary
because X allows for servers with very different video characteristics
(for example, horizontal and vertical resolution, screen and pixel size,
pixel shape, and so on) to potentially access the same font library.
The font name, for example, must differentiate between a 14-point font designed
for 75 dpi (body size of about 14 pixels) or a 14-point font designed
for 150 dpi (body size of about 28 pixels).
Further, in servers that implement some or all fonts as continuously scaled
and scan-converted outlines,
POINT_SIZE and RESOLUTION_Y will help the server to differentiate
between potentially separate font masters for text, title,
and display sizes or for other typographic considerations.

(that is, the glyphs of the font can be modeled by X clients as "boxes"
of the same width and height that are imaged side-by-side
to form text strings or top-to-bottom to form text lines).
By definition,
all glyphs have the same logical character width,
and no glyphs have "ink" outside of the character cell.
There is no kerning (that is, on a per-character basis with positive metrics:
0 &lt;= left-bearing &lt;= right-bearing &lt;= width;
with negative metrics: width &lt;= left-bearing &lt;= right-bearing &lt;= zero).
Also, the vertical extents of the font do not exceed the vertical spacing
(that is, on a per-character basis:
ascent &lt;= font-ascent and descent &lt;= font-descent).
The cell height = font-descent + font-ascent, and the width = AVERAGE_WIDTH.

AVERAGE_WIDTH is an integer-string typographic metric value
that gives the unweighted arithmetic mean of the absolute value of the
width of each glyph in the font
(measured in tenths of pixels), multiplied by -1 if the dominant
writing direction for the font is right-to-left.
A leading "~" (TILDE) indicates a negative value.

this is the width of all glyphs in the font.

<!-- .LP -->
Although the X protocol does not explicitly have any knowledge about
character set encodings,
it is expected that server implementors will prefer to embed knowledge
of certain proprietary or standard charsets into their font library
for reasons of performance and convenience.
The CHARSET_REGISTRY and CHARSET_ENCODING fields or properties allow
an X client font request to specify a specific charset mapping
in server environments where multiple charsets are supported.
The availability of any particular
character set is font and server implementation dependent.

An XLFD name presented to the server can have the POINT_SIZE or PIXEL_SIZE
field begin with the character "[".  If the first character of the field
is "[", the character must be followed with ASCII representations of
four floating point numbers and a trailing "]", with white space
separating the numbers and optional white space separating the numbers
from the "[" and "]" characters.  Numbers use standard floating point
syntax but use the character "~" to represent a minus sign in the mantissa
or exponent.

The XLFD is designed to support scalable fonts.  A scalable font is a
font source from which instances of arbitrary size can be derived.
A scalable font source might be one or more outlines
together with zero or more hand-tuned bitmap fonts at specific sizes and
resolutions, or it might be a programmatic description together with
zero or more bitmap fonts, or some other format
(perhaps even just a single bitmap font).

</itemizedlist>

<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The global list consists of font names derived from font sources.
If a single font source can support multiple character sets (specified
in the CHARSET_REGISTRY and CHARSET_ENCODING fields), each such character
set should be used to form a separate font name in the list.
For a nonscalable font source, the simple font name
for each character set is included in the global list.
For a scalable font source, a scalable font name for each character set
is included in the list.  In addition to the scalable font name,
specific derived instance names may also be included in the list.
The relative order of derived instances with respect to the scalable
font name is not constrained.  Finally, font name aliases may also be included
in the list.  The relative order of aliases
with respect to the real font name is not constrained.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The values of the RESOLUTION_X and RESOLUTION_Y fields of a scalable font name
are implementation dependent,
but to maximize backward compatibility, they
should be reasonable nonzero values, for example, a resolution close to that
provided by the screen (in a single-screen server).
Because some existing
applications rely on seeing a collection of point and pixel sizes,
server vendors are strongly encouraged in the near term to
provide a mechanism for including, for each scalable font name,
a set of specific derived instance names.  For font sources that contain
a collection of hand-tuned bitmap fonts, including names of these instances
in the global list is recommended and sufficient.
</para>

<!-- .LP -->
The X protocol request
<function>ListFonts</function>
on a well-formed XLFD pattern returns the following.
Starting with the global list, if the actual pattern argument
has values containing no wildcards in scalable fields,
then substitute each such field into the corresponding
field in each scalable font name in the list.  For each resulting font name,
if the remaining scalable fields cannot be replaced with values to produce a
derived instance, remove the font name from the list.  Now take the modified
list, and perform a simple pattern match against the pattern argument.
<function>ListFonts</function>
returns the resulting list.

<title>Polymorphic Fonts</title>
<!-- .XS -->
<!-- (SN Polymorphic Fonts -->
<!-- .XE -->
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Fonts that can be varied in ways other than size or resolution are called
<emphasis remap='I'>polymorphic fonts.</emphasis>  Multiple Master Type 1 font programs are one type of
a polymorphic font.  Current examples of axes along which the fonts can be
varied are width, weight, and optical size; others might include formality
or x-height.
</para>
<para>
To support polymorphic fonts, special values indicating variability are
defined for the following XLFD fields:
</para>
<blockquote>
<para>
<!-- .nf -->
	WEIGHT_NAME
</para>
<para>
	SLANT
</para>
<para>
	SETWIDTH_NAME
</para>
<para>
	ADD_STYLE_NAME
</para>
</blockquote>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The string "0" is the special polymorphic value.  In the
WEIGHT_NAME, SLANT, or SETWIDTH_NAME field, "0" must be the
entire field.
There may be multiple polymorphic values
in the ADD_STYLE_NAME field.
They are surrounded by "[" and "]" and separated by a Space,
as "[0\00]".  The polymorphic values may coexist with
other data in the field.
It is recommended that the polymorphic values
be at the end of the ADD_STYLE_NAME field.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The font-matching algorithms for a font with polymorphic fields are
identical to the matching algorithms for a font with scalable fields.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
There are three new font properties to describe the axes of variation,
AXIS_NAMES, AXIS_LIMITS, and AXIS_TYPES.  AXIS_NAMES is a list of all the
names of the axes for the font, separated by a null (0) byte.
These names are suitable for presentation in
a user interface.  AXIS_LIMITS is a list of integers, two for each axis,
giving the minimum and maximum allowable values for that axis.
AXIS_TYPES is like AXIS_NAMES,
but can be registered as having specific semantics.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The axes are listed in the properties in the same order as they
appear in the font name.  They are matched with font name fields by
looking for the special polymorphic values in the font name.

<para>
If a font name that contains the polymorphic value or a wildcard in a
polymorphic field is presented to a font source, the font source is free
to substitute any value that is convenient.  However, font sources should
try to use a value that would be considered
<emphasis remap='I'>normal</emphasis> or
<emphasis remap='I'>medium</emphasis> for the
particular font.  For example, if an optical size variable is unresolved,
the font source should provide a value appropriate to the size of the
font.
</para>

<para>
The result of specifying an out-of-range value for a polymorphic field is
undefined.  The font source may treat this as a
<function>BadName</function> error, treat the
value as if it were the closest legal value, or extrapolate to try to
accommodate the value.

A simple method of testing for conformance would entail verifying that the
<function>FontNameRegistry</function>
prefix is the string "-",
that the number of field delimiters in the string and coded field values
are valid,
and that each font property name either matches a standard XLFD property name
or follows the definition of a private property.

FONT_ASCENT, FONT_DESCENT, and DEFAULT_CHAR are provided in the BDF

FONT_ASCENT is an integer value (of type INT32)
that gives the recommended typographic ascent above the baseline
for determining interline spacing.
Specific glyphs of the font may extend beyond this.
If the current position point for line <emphasis remap='I'>n</emphasis> is at [X,Y],
then the origin of the next line <emphasis remap='I'>m = n + 1</emphasis>
(allowing for a possible font change) is
[X, Y + FONT_DESCENTn + FONT_ASCENTm].

The DEFAULT_CHAR is an unsigned integer value (of type CARD32)
that specifies the index
of the default character to be used by the X server when an attempt
is made to display an undefined or nonexistent character in the font.
(For a font using a 2-byte matrix format,
the index bytes are encoded in the integer as byte1 * 65536 + byte2.)
If the DEFAULT_CHAR itself specifies an undefined or nonexistent character
in the font,
then no display is performed.
