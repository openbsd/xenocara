<para>
X11R&relvers; is an Open Source version of the X Window System that
supports many <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> and UNIX-like
operating systems (such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris)
on a variety of platforms.  This version is compatible with
X11R&prevrelvers; and other X Window System implementations which support
the X11 standard.

<para>
Update releases are taken from a stable/maintenance branch. They are
designed to be installed on top of the full release that they are updating.
They contain fixes for serious problems, most commonly fixes for security
issues, fixes for driver bugs, and fixes that improve stability.

The X.Org Foundation X releases are produced by the X.Org Foundation.
The X.Org Foundation has been formed as a Delaware corporation organized
to operate as a scientific charity under IRS code 501(c)(3) chartered
to develop and execute effective strategies which provide world-wide
stewardship of the X Window System technology and standards. Membership
in the X.Org Foundation is free to all participants. Applications for
Membership are now being accepted, and active participants in the
further development of the X Window Technology are invited to complete a
<ulink

>membership application</ulink>.  The X11R&relvers; release has been
produced by the many contributors to the X.Org community and members of
the X.Org Foundation and includes code from the X Consortium, the Open
Group and the <trademark class="registered">XFree86</trademark> Project.
This release is dedicated to the greater X community, developers and
users alike.

<title>Licensing</title>

<para>
X Window System source code is covered by many licenses.  All of these
licenses have in common the fact that they do not impose significant
conditions on the modification or redistribution or either source code
or binaries beyond requiring one or more of the following:

</para>

<para>
Most of these licenses are based on the MIT, X Consortium, or BSD
(original and revised) licenses.  All of them are consistent with the
<ulink

>Open Source Definition</ulink
>, and most are
consistent with the Free Software Foundation's <ulink

<para>
Copyright and Licensing information for X, including the reproduction
of copyright and/or license notices and attributions required by some

in that document, please contact us with details at
<email>xorg@lists.freedesktop.org</email>.
While the current licenses are all open source licenses, the
X.Org Foundation is attempting, with time, to bring as much as
possible of the code's licenses in the distribution into compliance with the

<para>
This is the &whichfullrel; release of the new modular source code tree.  The
source code has been split into nine logical modules: app, data, doc,
driver, font, lib. proto, util and xserver.  Each of these modules
contain one or more packages that can be configured, built and installed
separately.  Please see an X11R&relvers; release site for a complete
list of the tarballs.
</para>

<para>
For information on how to build the modular tree packages see the <ulink
url="http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ModularDevelopersGuide"
>Modular Developer's Guide</ulink
>.  This guide also
contains information for developers who want to help improve the modular
build system and modular code base.

<title>Reporting Bugs</title>

<para>
Bugs should be reported to freedesktop.org's <ulink

using the xorg component.  Before
reporting bugs, please check the server log file, which can be found at
<filename>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</filename> on most platforms.  If you can't
resolve the problem yourself, send the entire log file with your bug report but
not the operating system core dump.  Do not edit the log file as our
developers use it to reproduce and debug your problem.  Please attach it
to your bug report.
