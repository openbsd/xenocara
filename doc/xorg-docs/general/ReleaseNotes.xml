    <title>Introduction to the X11R&relvers; Release</title>

    <para>
      This release is the &whichfullrel; modular release of the
      <productname>X Window System</productname>.
      The next full release will be X11R&nextrelvers; and is expected in
      &nextfullreldate;.
    </para>

    <para>
      Unlike X11R1 through X11R6.9, X11R7.x releases are not built from one
      monolithic source tree, but many individual modules.   These modules
      are distributed as individual source code releases, and each one is
      released when it is ready, instead of only when the overall window
      system is ready for release.  The X11R7.x releases are made by
      &ldquo;rolling up&rdquo; the individual module releases into a
      collection that is often affectionately called the
      &ldquo;<foreignphrase>katamari</foreignphrase>&rdquo; by the developers.
    </para>

    <para>
      The X11R&relvers; release does not include all of the software
      formerly included in the previous X Window System releases.
      It is designed to be a reasonable baseline from which to start
      when building the window system for the first time for a new
      installation, distribution, or package set.  It does not provide
      a full desktop environment, expecting a more feature rich set of
      applications to be installed from one of the several excellent
      desktop environments available for the X Window System.  The
      X.Org developers continue to maintain and produce new releases
      of much of the software that was formerly in the main window
      system releases but is no longer included in the katamari
      releases, including many of the Athena Widgets desktop
      applications that were provided as samples in previous window
      system versions.
    </para>

    <para>
      Once their window system build is established, most builders watch for
      announcements of individual module updates on the <ulink
	url="http://lists.x.org/mailman/listinfo/xorg-announce"
	>xorg-announce mailing list</ulink> and update to those as needed.
      The X.Org Foundation currently releases the X Window System
      katamari releases approximately once a year, but many modules,
      especially the X servers and drivers, are updated more frequently
      between those releases.

<para>
The release numbering is based on the original MIT X numbering system.
X11 refers to the version of the network protocol that the X Window
system is based on: Version 11 was first released in 1988 and has been
stable for nearly 25 years, with only upward compatible additions to the core X
protocol, a record of stability envied in computing.  Formal releases of
X started with X version 9 from MIT; the first commercial X products
were based on X version 10.  The MIT X Consortium and its successors,
the X Consortium, the Open Group X Project Team, and the X.Org Group
released versions X11R3 through X11R6.6.  Since the founding of the
X.Org Foundation in early 2004, many further releases have been
issued, from X11R6.7 to the current &relvers;.

	    Xorg server 1.12 and later via the Xinput extension version 2.2.

	    including allowing clients to track raw events from input devices,
	    additional detail in scrolling events so that clients may perform
	    smoother scrolling, and additional constants in the Xlib-based
	    libXi API.

	    More progress has been made on the X.Org Documentation
	    modernization - the rest of the library and protocol specifications
	    have been converted to DocBook XML from the variety of formats they
	    were previously in, and support for cross-linking between documents
	    hase been added.  On most systems these documents will be
	    installed under <filename>/usr/share/doc/</filename>.  They
	    are also posted on the X.Org website at
	    <ulink url="http://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/" />.

            <firstterm>Fence</firstterm> objects are now available in Version
            3.1 of the <olink targetdoc="sync" targetptr="sync">Synchronization
            (<quote>Sync</quote>) extension</olink>.   These allow clients
            to create a object that is either in <quote>triggered</quote>
            or <quote>not-triggered</quote> state, and to perform actions
            when the object becomes triggered.   When a client requests a
            fence be triggered, the X server will first complete all rendering
            from previous requests that affects resources owned by the fence's
            screen before changing the state, so that clients may synchronize
            with such rendering.  Support for these has been added to both
	    the <filename class="libraryfile">libxcb-sync</filename> and
	    <filename class="libraryfile">libXext</filename> API's.

            <firstterm>Pointer barriers</firstterm> were added by X Fixes
            extension Version 5.0.  Compositing managers and desktop
            environments may have UI elements in particular screen locations
            such that for a single-headed display they correspond to easy
            targets, for example, the top left corner.  For a multi-headed
            environment these corners should still be semi-impermeable.
            Pointer barriers allow the application to define additional
            constraint on cursor motion so that these areas behave as
            expected even in the face of multiple displays.

	    Version 1.2 of the X Resource extension provides new requests

	    information about other clients, such as their process id,

	    have allocated in the X server, to allow better observability
	    and easier debugging of client resource allocations in the server.

    <title>Overview of X11R&relvers;</title>

    <para>
      On most platforms, X11R&relvers; has a single hardware-driving
      X server binary called <command>Xorg</command>.  This binary can
      dynamically load the video drivers, input drivers, and other modules
      that are needed.

      <command>Xorg</command> currently has support for Linux, Solaris,
      and some BSD OSs on Alpha, PowerPC, IA-64, AMD64, Intel x86, Sparc,
      and MIPS platforms.

    </para>

    <para>
      Additional specialized X server binaries may be found depending on
      the platform and build configuration, including:

	      which is an X proxy, and thus limited to the capabilities of
	      the host X server, <command>Xephyr</command> is a full X server
	      which uses the host X server window as a
	      &ldquo;framebuffer&rdquo; via fast SHM XImages.

        <para>
	  The Xorg server relies on the operating system's native
	  module loader support for handling program modules. The X

	  extensions, input device drivers, framebuffer layers, and
	  internal components used by some drivers (like XAA &amp; EXA).
        </para>

        <para>
        The module interfaces (both API and ABI) used in this release are
        subject to change without notice.  While we will attempt to provide
        backward compatibility for the module interfaces in stable releases,
        we cannot guarantee this. Compatibility in the other direction is
        explicitly not guaranteed because new modules may rely on interfaces
        added in new releases, nor is compatibility across stable release
        branches (such as between Xorg 1.11 and 1.12).

        <title>Note about module security</title>
        <para>The Xorg server runs with root privileges, so

        introduction of malware and contaminated code can occur and
        wreak havoc on your system.

      <sect3 id='Configuration_File'>
<title>Configuration File</title>

        <para>
        The Xorg server uses a configuration file as the primary mechanism
        for providing configuration and run-time parameters.  The configuration
        file format is described in detail in the <ulink url="xorg.conf.5.html">
        xorg.conf(5)</ulink> manual page.
        </para>

        <para>
        Note that this release features significant improvements
        for running the server without a configuration file, so many users
        may find that that they don't need a configuration file, or may
	rely on just snippets of configuration placed in the
	<filename class="directory">xorg.conf.d</filename> directory.
        </para>

        <para>
        If you do need to customize the configuration file, see the <ulink
        url="xorg.conf.5.html"

        check the driver-specific manual pages and the related
        documentation (found at <xref linkend="drivertables"></xref>) also.
        </para>

        <para>
        The recommended method for generating a configuration file is to use
        the Xorg server itself.  Run as root:

        <screen>
        Xorg -configure
        </screen>
         and follow the instructions.

	  Support for multiple PCI/AGP cards may require a kernel with
	  changes to support VGA arbitration.
        </para>

        <para>
        One of the main problems is with drivers not sufficiently
        initializing cards that were not initialized at boot time.  This
        has been improved somewhat with the INT10 support that is used by
        most drivers (which allows secondary card to be "soft-booted", but
        in some cases there are other issues that still need to be
        resolved.  Some combinations can be made to work better by changing
        which card is the primary card (either by using a different PCI
        slot, or by changing the system BIOS's preference for the primary
        card).

        <title>Xinerama</title>
        <para>
        <firstterm>Xinerama</firstterm> is an X server extension that
        allows multiple physical screens connected to multiple video devices
        to behave as a single screen.  With traditional multi-head in X11,
        windows cannot span or cross physical screens.  Xinerama removes this
        limitation.  Xinerama does, however, require that the physical screens
        all have the same root depth, so it isn't possible, for example, to use
        an 8-bit screen together with a 16-bit screen in Xinerama mode.
        </para>

        <para>
        Xinerama is not enabled by default, and can be enabled with the
        <option>+xinerama</option> command line option for the X server.
        Note that enabling Xinerama may disable certain other extensions
        which are not compatible with Xinerama.

        <para>
	  The <acronym>VESA</acronym>&reg; Display Data Channel
	  (<acronym><trademark>DDC</trademark></acronym>) standard allows
	  the monitor to tell the video card (or in some cases the
	  computer directly) about itself; particularly the supported
	  screen resolutions and refresh rates.
        </para>

        <para>
        Partial or complete DDC support is available in most of the video
        drivers.  DDC is enabled by default, but can be disabled with a
        "Device" section entry:  <literal remap="tt">Option
        "NoDDC"</literal>.  We have support for DDC versions 1 and 2; these
        can be disabled independently with <literal remap="tt">Option
        "NoDDC1"</literal> and <literal remap="tt">Option
        "NoDDC2"</literal>.
        </para>

        <para>
        At startup the server prints out DDC information from the display,
        and can use this information to set the default monitor parameters,
        or to warn about monitor sync limits if those provided in the
        configuration file don't match those that are detected.
        </para>

        <sect4 id='Changed_behavior_in_handling_information_from_DDC'>
            <title>Changed behavior in handling information from DDC</title>

            <para>
              The X server previously used DDC information to detect screen
              size and pitch, and compute DPI automatically, allowing fonts
              and other UI elements to automatically scale to appropriate
              sizes.  This mechanism worked reasonably well for many
              single-monitor cases, but did not compute accurate DPI values
              for multi-monitor cases or less common single-display setups.
              Thus, this autodetection has been removed, and the X server no
              longer tries to compute an appropriate DPI value.  All users
              wanting fonts, physical measurement units, and other UI elements
              scaled appropriately for their display (including users for whom
              autodetection previously worked) must now set DPI or some other
              scaling factor explicitly, either via the X server's
              <option>-dpi</option> option, a DPI setting in their graphical
              enironment, or an alternate scaling mechanism provided by their
              environment.

        <para>
        Of note is that this release supports building the X server using
        the system-wide libdrm. Previously, drm was kept in the server's
        tree and loaded as a module, rather than using the standard OS
        mechanisms for managing shared libraries of code. This requires
        that the server be built using a version of libdrm of 2.3.0 or
        newer if it is to use DRM.

	  <keycap function="backspace">Backspace</keycap>.
	  While this function is still enabled by default in this release,
	  the keymap data usually used with Xorg, from the

          The Xorg server in this release provides various functions
          that can be mapped to keystrokes to aid in the debugging of
          programs with errant input grabs.
        </para>
        <para>
          The keysyms <keysym>XF86LogGrabInfo</keysym> and
          <keysym>XF86LogWindowTree</keysym> are defined to
          print information to the Xorg log file on the current set
          of input grabs, and the window tree of the current display.
          By default, these are available for use, but not mapped to any key.
        </para>
        <para>
          The keysym <keysym>XF86Ungrab</keysym> forces the X server
          to release all active grabs, which may leave the clients holding
          them in an inconsistent state.  <keysym>XF86ClearGrab</keysym>
          goes further, killing the client connection of any client holding
          an active grab when it is pressed.   These keystrokes are
          intended to allow developers to debug clients which are not
          properly releasing grabs or have problems occur while input is
          grabbed.   Since grabs are a fundamental part of the X
          client security model, these keystrokes come with risks, such
          as the ability to bypass or kill screen locks without knowing
          the password, and thus are not available by default.
        </para>
        <para>
          Users who are willing to accept the security risk and wish to enable

    <sect2 id='Strict_compilation_flags'>
      <title>Strict compilation flags</title>

      <para>
        Most of the modules in this release use stricter compiler flags
        when building with the GNU gcc, LLVM clang, Oracle Solaris Studio,
        or Intel compilers.   These flags both enable more warnings, and
        promote some warnings to fatal errors in the build.   If these
        flags cause your build to fail, you can disable the flags that
        turn these selected warnings into errors by adding
        <option>--disable-selective-werror</option> to the configure command
        for the affected module.   If that is necessary for any X.Org modules,
        please report a bug in the xorg product on
        <ulink url="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/" />.
      </para>

      <para>
        Builders seeking even stricter compiler checks can instead pass
        <option>--enable-strict-compilation</option> to the configure command
        to make all warnings become errors.

    <sect2 id='Silent_build_rules'>

      <para>
	Most of the modules in this release use the

	When building the software, most output will show an abbreviated
	format for the commands being run, such as:
	<screen>
   CC	xmen.o
	</screen>
	To enable verbose output, showing all the arguments to the commands
	being run, add the flag <option>V=1</option> to the
	<command>make</command> command line or add the flag
	<option>--disable-silent-rules</option> to the configure command.

    <sect2 id='Socket_directory_ownership_and_permissions'>
        <title>Socket directory ownership and permissions</title>

      <para>
	The socket directories created in <filename>/tmp</filename>
        are now required to be owned by root and have their sticky-bit
        set.  If the permissions are not set correctly, the component
        using this directory will print an error message and fail to
        start.  Common socket directories that are known to be
        affected include:

        <screen>
        /tmp/.font-unix
        /tmp/.ICE-unix
        /tmp/.X11-unix
        </screen>

        These directories are used by the font server
	(<command>xfs</command>), applications using the Inter-Client
	Exchange protocol (<acronym>ICE</acronym>) and the X server,
	respectively.
      </para>

      <para>
        There are several solutions to the problem of when to create these
        directories.  They could be created at install time by the system's
        installer if the <filename class="directory">/tmp</filename> dir is
        persistent.  They could be created at boot time by the system's
        boot scripts (e.g., the <filename class="directory" >init.d</filename>
        scripts).  Or, they could be created by PAM modules at service
        startup or user login time.
      </para>

      <para>
        The solution chosen is platform dependent, and the system administrator
        should be able to handle creating those directories on any systems that
        do not have the correct ownership or permissions.

    <title>Deprecated components and removal plans</title>

    <para>
    This section lists current plans for removal of obsolete or deprecated
    components in the X.Org releases.  As our releases are open source,
    users who continue to require these can find the source in previous
    releases and continue to use these, but the X.Org Foundation and its
    volunteers have decided the burden of continued maintenance and
    distribution in the core X11 releases outweighs the benefits of doing
    so.  In some cases, this is simply because no one has volunteered to do
    continued maintenance, so if software is listed here that you need, you
    can contact <email>xorg-devel@lists.x.org</email> to volunteer to
    take over maintainership, either inside or outside of the Xorg release
    process.
