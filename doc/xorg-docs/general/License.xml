<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
The X.Org Foundation X Window System distribution is a compilation of code and
documentation from many sources.  This document is intended primarily
as a guide to the licenses used in the distribution: you must check
each file and/or package for precise redistribution
terms. None-the-less, this summary may be useful to many users.
</para>

<para>
This document is based on the compilation from XFree86.
If you find any errors or significant omissions in this document, please
contact us with details at <email>xorg@lists.freedesktop.org</email>.
</para>

<para>
Most of these licenses are based on the MIT, X Consortium, or BSD
(original and revised) licenses.  All of them are consistent with the
<ulink url="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php"
>Open Source Definition</ulink>, and most are
consistent with the Free Software Foundation's <ulink
url="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software
Definition</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
While the current licenses are all open source licenses, the
X.Org Foundation is attempting, over time, to bring as much as
possible of the code's licenses in the distribution into compliance with the
<ulink url="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines"
>Debian Free Software Guidelines</ulink>.
</para>

<sect1>
<title>X.Org Preferred License</title>

<para>
The X.Org Foundation has chosen the following format of the MIT
License as the preferred format for code included in the X Window System
distribution.   This is a slight variant of the common MIT license
form published by the Open Source Initiative at
<ulink url="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php"></ulink>.
